<h2><a name="THE_EXPEDITION_BEGINS" id="THE_EXPEDITION_BEGINS"></a>THE EXPEDITION BEGINS</h2>


<p>Madeline Moffet stood on the corner beside the big sign
that said USE DRAGON MOTOR OIL. She liked to think of
the sign as a warning, BEWARE OF DRAGONS and the dragons
as Mr. and Mrs. Lippett who lived in the farm house beside
the sign. Muffs boarded with them. She had been told to go
out and play but there was no one to play with except the chickens.
They made little friendly noises and tilted their heads.</p>

<p>“Talk! Talk!” they said and flocked after her.</p>

<p>Muffs wanted to talk with somebody. The dragons had
an idea that children should be seen and not heard and so she
had kept everything she wanted to say all bottled up inside
herself. She thought the chickens felt differently about it until
she tried to catch one. Its squawking frightened her and she
dropped all of it but one long tail feather which came out and
was left waving in her hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll make b’lieve I’m an Indian,” she said to herself and
stuck the feather in her yellow hair.</p>

<p>Indians were supposed to follow trails. Muffs looked up
the big road with its little stores and shops and farm houses
scattered in between and decided at once that wouldn’t do for
a trail. Then she looked down the little road that went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the woods to the house where the Tylers lived. Overhanging
trees made it seem like a long tunnel. It reminded her of the
subway and shopping trips at home with her mother. She
walked slowly, thinking of her mother and their little apartment
in New York. They called it “the studio” and it was a tiny place
with paintings hanging all about and Muffs’ own little bed hidden
behind a green and gold screen. Last night her bed had
been hidden behind a curtain on the train. The curtain was
green, like those overhanging trees. Suddenly Muffs began to
feel very sad and homesick. Then she heard something. It
was the strangest sort of thing she had ever heard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">Gilly gilly galoo-oo,</div>
<div class="line">I wonder who are you-oo!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It sounded like a song and it came from a tree almost above
her head. She looked up. There, in the branches of the tree,
was a little boy about her own age. He was looking down at
her with a friendly sort of grin as he kept on chanting the song.</p>

<p>“I wonder who you are too-oo!” Muffs sang back to him.</p>

<p>“I’m a great discoverer,” he said, sliding out of the tree and
leaning against its trunk. “My name’s Tommy Tyler.”</p>

<p>“And I’m Miss Muffet. I’m staying with the dragons who
live at the end of this road. Didn’t you see the big sign, BEWARE
OF DRAGONS? That means Mr. and Mrs. Lippett.”</p>

<p>“I live at the other end,” said Tommy, “with Mom and
Daddy and Great Aunt Charlotte and Donald and Mary and the
baby.”</p>

<p>“My! What a lot of people!” Muffs exclaimed. “In my
family there’s only Mother and me. Daddy went off and left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
us when I was just three years old. I touched some of his things
and he went to the ends of the earth because there aren’t any
children there.”</p>

<p>“Did he <em>say</em> that?” questioned Tommy, coming closer to
Muffs. He liked this strange little girl from somewhere else.
She was so different from his sister, Mary, and all the children
he knew at school.</p>

<p>“I don’t exactly remember what he said,” Muffs admitted,
“but I do know he stomped out of the room and pushed the
elevator button so hard he caught his finger&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s an alligator button?”</p>

<p>“<em>Elevator</em> button,” said Muffs. “It’s to call the elevators.
In New York you go up and down in elevators like little moving
houses. The stairs go up and down sometimes too and the subways
go <em>right under the river</em>.”</p>

<p>“Ooo! Don’t you get all wet?”</p>

<p>Muffs laughed. “’Course not. It’s a tunnel. It goes
under where the water is.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a tunnel,” Tommy said importantly. “I discovered
it. It goes under the floor in the workshop.”</p>

<p>Now it was Muffs’ turn to question and Tommy’s to answer.</p>

<p>“Can you go in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you have to crawl and you’re all dressed up.
I made a house in there for the Gilly Galoo Bird and Thomas
Junior. <em>They</em> like it but you wouldn’t. The dust makes you
sneeze.”</p>

<p>“Don’t the Gilly Galoo Bird and Thomas Junior sneeze?”</p>

<p>“Thomas Junior’s too busy catching rats and the Gilly
Galoo Bird can’t sneeze ’’cause he’s made of iron. He’s a magic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
bird and lives in Daddy’s carpenter shop. Want to see him?”</p>

<p>Muffs did want to see him. The carpenter shop sounded
as new and strange to her as her elevators and subways did to
Tommy. Each felt that the other was a little unreal. Afraid to
take each other’s hands, they started up the road side by side.
A big black cat darted out from somewhere in the bushes and
began following them.</p>

<p>“That’s Thomas Junior,” Tommy explained. “He likes
to go places with me ’cause I’m his master. There’s the house,”
he added, pointing to it as they turned the bend in the road.</p>

<p>Muffs saw two houses, like twin shadows, against the white
sky. A walk connected them and at the far end of the walk
on a little flight of steps, sat a girl whom she knew must be Mary.
She was rocking a baby carriage gently back and forth and singing
a lullaby that fitted the tune of Rock-a-bye Baby, and went
like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">Go to sleep, baby. You are so dear.</div>
<div class="line">Go to sleep, baby. Sister is near.</div>
<div class="line">Go to sleep, baby. Mother will come.</div>
<div class="line">Go to sleep, baby and sister will hum</div>
<div class="line">Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm ...</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But while she was humming, Tommy and Muffs came into
the wood yard.</p>

<p>“It’s plain as plain,” Tommy announced. “We’re not real
people at all. Ellen is the baby in the tree-top, I’m Tommy
Tucker and you’re the contrary Mary who had the garden. And
this,” he added, making a low bow and waving one hand toward
Muffs, “is little Miss Muffet who sat on a tuffet only she’s frightened
away by dragons instead of spiders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Mary stopped humming and looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Is your real name Little Miss Muffet?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It’s Madeline Moffet,” the little girl explained, “but
Mother’s name is Madeline too so people call me Miss Muffet
or Muffins or just plain Muffs.”</p>

<p>“She’s from New York,” said Tommy. “She rides in
alligators under the river. I wanted to show her Balo.”</p>

<p>“What’s Balo?” asked Muffs.</p>

<p>“It’s what I call the workshop when I’m playing,” Tommy
explained. “All of Daddy’s tools come to life and talk and
walk an’ everything. The hammer is a snake, the monkey
wrench a gilly galoo bird and Daddy’s old broom is a tailor with
a funny face.”</p>

<p>“Are they alive now?” asked Muffs as she stood on tiptoe
and peered into the shop window.</p>

<p>“No, because we’re not playing Balo. We’re being make-believe
people out of books.”</p>

<p>“I’m being myself,” said Mary, “and I don’t want to play.”</p>

<p>“You are playing! You are playing!” Muffs and Tommy
both shouted. “You’re being contrary and that makes you
Contrary Mary.”</p>

<p>“I am not contrary and you don’t sing for your supper
either, Tommy Tyler, because you can’t carry a tune.”</p>

<p>“I can sing-song,” said Tommy, “and it sounds magic.
Muffs can sing-song too because she sing-songed back at me when
I was calling gilly-galoo out of the tree. That makes us not
real and everything we do all day MAGIC.”</p>

<p>“What’s that feather in your hair?” asked Mary eyeing the
new girl doubtfully.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
<img src="images/p03.jpg" width="500" height="503" alt="She jumped over the One Way Steps and
almost spilled the basket" />
</div>

<p>“I was playing Indian,” Muffs explained. “I was following
a trail.”</p>

<p>“It was just our road,” Tommy put in. “That’s too wide
for a trail. But I know where there’s a real trail we could follow.
It’s somewhere over in those woods.” He pointed to the
hillside beyond the apple orchard. “Remember, Mary, we
started to follow it once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Mary exclaimed. “I remember. But it’s a
long trail. It would take all day.”</p>

<p>“We could pack some lunch,” Tommy suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and pack some now!”</p>

<p>So Mary, as eager for a picnic as the two younger children,
wheeled the baby around to the front porch and left Great
Aunt Charlotte minding her. Then she ran into the kitchen
and asked Mrs. Tyler if she might have a basket. Together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
they filled it with bread and cookies as well as a big jar of strawberry
jam.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Mary, opening the kitchen door and
running along the narrow walk that the children had named
the Way of Peril. She jumped over the One Way Steps and
almost spilled the basket. “Here we are! All ready to start
on the expedition.”</p>

<p>Tommy had whittled out a whistle from an elderberry
branch while she was packing the lunch.</p>

<p>“I’ll be the leader!” he cried, blowing the whistle.</p>

<p>“No, I will,” cried contrary Mary.</p>

<p>“But I thought of it,” Tommy insisted. “I should be the
leader.”</p>

<p>“No, I should!”</p>

<p>It began to sound like a quarrel and, as the day was much
too fine for quarreling, Muffs sat down on the One Way Steps
to think of a way out. It had been a quarrel that had sent her
father to the ends of the earth and she didn’t want anything
to spoil this expedition.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” she exclaimed. “We’re supposed to
be story book people so let’s all say Mother Goose rhymes and
the one who thinks of the most can take the lead.”</p>

<p>Mary and Tommy looked at each other doubtfully, but
both of them loved a game and so it was agreed that they should
begin by saying the rhymes that fitted their own names. More
and more followed until Mary could not think of another one
and had to drop out. Tommy thought of three rhymes after
that but Muffs knew at least a dozen more.</p>

<p>“I’ll say a beautiful one this time,” she said with a toss of
her yellow curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
“No, an ugly one,” said contrary Mary.</p>

<p>“I like the funny ones best,” declared Tommy. “Then
we could start off laughing.”</p>

<p>Miss Muffet scratched her curly head a minute and then
her eyes began to dance as they always did whenever she thought
of something clever.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” she cried. “I’ll say a rhyme that’s
the prettiest and the ugliest and the funniest all together!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I could,” and to prove it she began reciting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">There was a man in our town and he was wondrous wise.</div>
<div class="line">He jumped into a bramble bush and scratched out both his eyes.</div>
<div class="line">Then when he saw his eyes were out, with all his might and main</div>
<div class="line">He jumped into another bush and scratched them in again.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“What’s beautiful about that?” asked Mary when she had
finished.</p>

<p>“The two words ‘wondrous wise’,” she replied. “And the
ugly part is where he scratched his eyes out and the funny part
is where he scratched them in again.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tommy thoughtfully. “There can be a real
Miss Muffet and a real Tommy Tucker and a real Contrary
Mary, <em>but there couldn’t be a really-and-truly Bramble Bush
Man</em>.”</p>

<p>“I think there could,” said contrary Mary. “Let’s play
he lives at the end of the trail.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” cried Muffs, clapping her hands. “Won’t it
be the most fun? Only I can’t be the leader,” she added a
minute afterwards, “’cause I don’t know the way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get you a Guide then. Here’s a hat for him,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
said Tommy handing her his own tall straw hat. Muffs stuck
her feather in to make the Guide look more like an Indian.</p>

<p>“But where is the Guide?” she asked presently.</p>

<p>Mary pointed to a clump of bushes where Tommy was
busily whittling away at something.</p>

<p>“I think he’s making him,” she whispered.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, when Tommy returned he had the
Guide by the hand. He was very thin and very tall and his hands
had leafy fingers. His twig nose pointed straight ahead of him
and his eyes were very sharp. Tommy’s sharp jack-knife had
cut them deep into his head and the gash that served as a mouth
was wide and smiling. Muffs slipped the hat over his head and
it fitted exactly. Holding the Guide ahead of them, the children
started off.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_A_BRAMBLE_BUSH" id="IN_A_BRAMBLE_BUSH"></a>IN A BRAMBLE BUSH</h2>


<p>Tommy walked beside Muffs in order to give directions
although that was properly the work of the silent Guide. Mary
trudged on behind as it was her turn to carry the basket of lunch.
They had passed the apple orchard and were following the
trail which might, if their play came true, lead to the Bramble
Bush Man’s house. There couldn’t be a real Bramble Bush
Man. At least the children couldn’t see exactly how a man
could scratch his eyes out and then scratch them in again and
still be wondrous wise. But they were looking for the impossible.
The trail was narrow and crooked and held no end of
mystery.</p>

<p>“Anything might happen,” Muffs said in a whisper.</p>

<p>It did seem that way. First they were in a patch of woods
so thick they could hardly see the sunshine. Then there would
be a grassy field; then woods again. And sometimes a rock
that they could hide behind. These were the jolliest games of
hide-and-seek that the children had ever played.</p>

<p>They had been in the deep woods for quite some time when
Tommy stopped short.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he exclaimed. “This isn’t the path I found.
See that hollow stump. I never saw that before.”</p>

<p>“It’s beginning to go down hill again,” cried Mary after
another five minutes of tramping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
“Do you suppose,” questioned Muffins doubtfully, “that a
wondrous wise man would live in the woods as far away from
other people as this?”</p>

<p>“Wise men like to be alone,” said Tommy knowingly.</p>

<p>“They like company,” contradicted Mary.</p>

<p>“I think you’re both right,” Muffins declared. “Sometimes
they like to be alone and sometimes they like company.
I’m that way too,” she added, seating herself on a stone to rest.</p>

<p>“Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,” sang out Tommy in
his tuneless voice.</p>

<p>“That stone is not a tuffet.”</p>

<p>But this time Tommy would not quarrel with Mary. It
might spoil the magic of their play. “Well,” he said slowly,
“if it isn’t a tuffet, then what is?”</p>

<p>None of them knew. Such a simple little word and yet
they hadn’t an idea in the world what it meant. They asked
the Guide and he only stared at them out of his sharp eyes and
the tap-tapping of his feet on the trail was their only answer.
But the Bramble Bush Man would know.</p>

<p>“We’ll ask him, first thing,” agreed Muffins. “Then if he
tells us the answer to that we’ll start asking him other things.”</p>

<p>“What other things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, millions of ’em. How to make my mother happy
and what people mean by the ends of the earth.”</p>

<p>“I know what they mean by the <em>ends of the moon</em>,” Mary
put in. “It really does have ends sometimes, just like the two
ends of a horn. We could ask him why.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Tommy proudly. “That’s the earth’s
shadow.”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Miss Muffet gazed at him for a minute and then Mary
said, “But you’re not wondrous wise ’cause you don’t know what
a tuffet is.”</p>

<p>Where the trail was steep the Guide helped Muffins climb.
When she grew tired she rested on his arms. She even shared
her lunch with him. Soon the basket was nearly empty.</p>

<p>“We’d better save the little that’s left,” Mary suggested,
“and pick berries if we’re hungry.”</p>

<p>There were plenty of berries along the path. In the cleared
places tall barberry bushes grew but their bright red fruit was
too sour and too filled with seeds. There were many kinds of
berries that the children didn’t dare eat for fear they might be
poison&mdash;and there were blackberries and tangles of brambles
hanging over the trail.</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve discovered the brambles,” Tommy declared,
“it will be lots easier to find the Bramble Bush Man!”</p>

<p>Muffs and Mary agreed that his house would probably be
covered with blackberry vines. Half believing their play, they
looked cautiously at either side of any bushes before they dared
pick berries from them. The Bramble Bush Man might be cross
if he caught them picking berries from his own private bushes.</p>

<p>“I think a wise man would be cross,” Muffins said.</p>

<p>But Mary, as usual, was contrary and thought he would be
kind. He would have to be very old too and yet young enough
to jump into brambles. They would keep on talking like that
until the whole thing got too puzzling. Then they would have
a game of hide-and-seek and forget it until, suddenly, the question
of the Bramble Bush Man’s wisdom would bob up again.</p>

<p>They had come to a regular forest of blackberry briars
and, once more, were playing hide-and-seek. Tommy was “it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
He had borrowed the Guide to help him hunt. They had already
found Mary, and Muffs could hear them trampling in among
the brambles looking for her. She crouched under a particularly
tall and brambly bush and plopped a berry in her mouth to
keep herself quiet.</p>

<p>“All out’s in free!” she heard them calling.</p>

<p>She scrambled to her feet and then, all in a flash, she saw
something sparkling in the late afternoon sun. It made little
flickers of light dance across the bramble bushes. Could it be&mdash;someone’s
eyes? The Bramble Bush Man’s?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Muffs called, “Mary! Tommy! Come here&mdash;QUICK!!!”</p>

<p>They came, pushing through the brush as fast as they
could and then they saw her pointing. There, with one bow
looped over a bramble, were the oddest looking pair of spectacles
that they had ever seen.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought they were eyes at first,” Miss Muffet stammered.</p>

<p>“They are eyes,” said Tommy solemnly as he unhooked the
bow. “Great Aunt Charlotte calls her glasses eyes and maybe
the Bramble Bush Man does too.”</p>

<p>“Then whoever puts them on will be wondrous wise,”
Muffs said.</p>

<p>“Let’s put them on the Guide then,” Mary suggested. “If
he’s wondrous wise he can surely show us the way to the Bramble
Bush Man’s house.”</p>

<p>“If he’s wondrous wise,” said Tommy, “then he is the
Bramble Bush Man and it’s his house we’re looking for.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAGIC_WAND" id="THE_MAGIC_WAND"></a>THE MAGIC WAND</h2>


<p>There were so many things to be discovered along the trail
they were following that the children thought they would be
wondrous wise themselves before they reached the end of it.</p>

<p>The greatest discoverer of all was the Guide. He wore the
Bramble Bush Man’s glasses on his twig nose and peered out
of the thick lenses for all the world like a college professor
studying maps of strange, undiscovered places. He pointed
ahead with his leafy arms and Muffs followed eagerly after him.
Tommy still insisted that the Guide was the Bramble Bush Man
but Muffs and Mary had set their hearts on finding the real
owner of the glasses.</p>

<p>“You know yourself,” Mary said practically, “that the
Guide didn’t lose the glasses and so they couldn’t be his.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he did. Maybe he lost them when he was still a
tree.”</p>

<p>“If he could talk,” Muffs said, “I might b’lieve he was
wondrous wise but he doesn’t say a word.”</p>

<p>“Wise people don’t talk,” declared Tommy, “unless they
have something to say. But look! He’s pointing. He’s pointing
to that bird’s nest right over our heads.”</p>

<p>Muffs had never seen a nest with eggs in it. The Guide
hooked an arm over the branch and bent it to show her the eggs
but she saw baby birds instead. Five of them! And all five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
had their bills open like cups. By standing right back of the
Guide she could see them through his glasses.</p>

<p>“It’s magic,” she cried. “The birds have turned into baby
dragons.”</p>

<p>Tommy looked too and, sure enough, everything was twice
as big through the glasses. He caught a small worm and held it
in his fingers.</p>

<p>“Here’s a snake for you, baby dragons,” he said.</p>

<p>Muffs and Mary fed them crumbs of bread and cookies.
Soon all five of the funny bills were closed and five pair of eyes
were blinking off to sleep. Shadows grew longer. The children
hurried a little faster and forgot to look through the glasses.</p>

<p>“My, it’s a long trail!” Muffs sighed after an hour or so
of hurrying. “Seems as if it must go to the ends of the earth.”</p>

<p>“The earth is round,” said Mary. “Round things haven’t
any ends.”</p>

<p>“Then there isn’t any such place?” asked Muffs, dismayed.
But Tommy pointed through the trees to where the earth and
sky seemed to meet each other.</p>

<p>“That looks like the end of the earth,” he declared. “If
we just keep on following the trail we’ll get there by night.”</p>

<p>“It’s night now,” said Muffs with a shiver as she leaned
heavily on the Guide. “I can’t even see the trail through his
glasses. You take the lead, Tommy. Maybe he’ll show you
the trail.”</p>

<p>She handed him the Guide and for some time they walked
on without a word. The noise of their feet in the brush sounded
louder now as if they were waking someone from sleep. Birds
chirped at them from the trees and twice a woodchuck crossed
in front of them. He sat up like a dog and seemed to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
“He thinks we ought not to be here,” Tommy said. “He
wants us to go home.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t we going home?” Mary asked.</p>

<p>But her little brother had stumbled over a log and was
busy picking himself up. Then he had to look for his whistle.
A tiny black beetle found it before he did and crawled inside.
Through the glasses he looked like some giant eclipsing the sun.
Tommy puffed out his cheeks and blew very hard, trying to get
him out. Mary saw him doing it and edged over to Muffs.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he sees the trail at all,” she whispered.
“Could we be lost?”</p>

<p>“Then Tommy could blow the whistle.”</p>

<p>“He’s trying to, but it won’t work,” Mary returned. “Even
if it did blow, no one would hear it way off here in the woods.”</p>

<p>Muffs had not thought of that. In New York people heard
whistles and there were always kind policemen to take lost children
home. Here they had nothing except the wooden Guide
and his head was too small to hold many brains. No one believed
in his wisdom now but Tommy. He was holding him
close to his face and peering anxiously through the glasses.</p>

<p>“Tommy!” Muffs called. “Can you really see the trail
through those glasses?”</p>

<p>“I can see it <em>through the glasses</em>,” he called back, “but
when I look again, it’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Then we are lost!” Mary cried. “I knew it! Tommy
had no right to take the lead.” And she began to cry.</p>

<p>Muffs felt like crying, too. Night made her think of her
own little bed back in the studio. Her mother was always there,
just outside the screen. Muffs had only to peep through a
crack to see her working away at her painting. Perhaps it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
would be a painted woods as green as the one they had just
passed through, or a sky as bright as their sky had been before
the sun sank in a pool of red clouds. She thought of all this
and then remembered that, for the first time in her life, she
would have to go to sleep without her mother’s kiss. There
would be no green and gold screen, no little bed, not even a
blanket ...</p>

<p>“I s’pose we’ll have to cover up in leaves like the babes in
the woods,” she said, her lip trembling.</p>

<p>Mary did not answer. She stood watching the trees grow
darker and darker as the last red cloud was swallowed up by
the hill. Tommy headed for the valley.</p>

<p>“We’re bound to come out somewhere,” he said hopefully.</p>

<p>“We are not,” Mary sobbed. “Lost people just keep going
’round and ’round in circles.”</p>

<p>“Then we aren’t lost,” Tommy declared. “We haven’t
passed the same thing once and we’ve had a Guide to lead us all
the way.”</p>

<p>Too tired to argue, Mary nodded and her hand tightened
on Muffins’ arm. The air felt chilly and a wind was whistling
overhead in the branches. Louder than Tommy’s whistle
sounded its ooo-ooo! Louder than their voices when they
called! Did the wind always make such a noise, Muffs wondered.
Was that a light ahead of them or only a star showing
through the trees?</p>

<p>All at once Tommy gave a shout and pointed.</p>

<p>“A house!”</p>

<p>It was indeed! And the queerest little house that ever
was. It had no door and the roof sloped nearly to the ground.
None of them had seen it before although it must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
there. A house couldn’t move. And yet this house seemed to
have appeared by magic.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s growing up out of the ground and isn’t all
up yet,” Muffs said in a whisper.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” Tommy agreed, “’specially the
window.”</p>

<p>“It’s the Bramble Bush Man’s house!” exclaimed Mary.
“Didn’t I tell you there could be a really-and-truly Bramble
Bush Man?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t believe it yourself when you said it.”</p>

<p>“Well, now I do,” she answered and turned again to look
at the house that couldn’t be a house at all. It kept right on
growing out of the ground as they walked toward it. Now they
could see all of the window. A long, narrow walk went up to
and right through it. Certainly nobody on earth except the
Bramble Bush Man would live in a house without a door.</p>

<p>“He might be a burglar,” said Muffs in a whisper. “Then
he’d be used to going in windows.”</p>

<p>Mary thought he was either a giant or a college professor
but Tommy still insisted he was the Guide. Whatever he was,
they were curious and kept on. If they paused it was only to
wonder something else and soon all three of them were walking
along the plank. It tilted this way and that and felt something
like standing up on a see-saw. They found the window halfway
open and it was easy to crawl through. Mary went first and
Muffs and Tommy followed her. They were dragging the poor
Guide after them. He made a scraping sound of protest as he
slid over the window sill. “Don’t do it! Don’t do it!” he
kept repeating but he had been silent all afternoon so now the
children wouldn’t listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
The first thing they saw was three other children scrambling
into another window on the opposite side of the room.
They started walking. So did the other children. They stopped
and the other children stopped too. The wooden Guide bowed
to another wooden Guide and suddenly everybody began to
giggle.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only us,” said Mary when she had stopped herself
from laughing.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Tommy, “it must be a giant’s looking-glass.”</p>

<p>“Oooo!” squealed Muffs. “The Bramble Bush Man must
be a giant. He’ll cook us and eat us if he finds us here!”</p>

<p>Mary looked hard at her. “Do you think,” she asked
seriously, “that a wondrous wise man would cook and eat little
children?”</p>

<p>“He’d be very kind,” Tommy added, “almost as kind as
Daddy. He’d let us play with the things in this room just like
Daddy lets us play with his tools in the carpenter shop.”</p>

<p>“Would he really?” asked Muffs. And then, all at once,
she knew perfectly well that the Bramble Bush Man was kind.
For there, on a long table, was a delicate cage of gold wire and
in it a little white rabbit was hopping about and twitching his
funny nose. He looked well cared for and nobody but a very
kind man would trouble himself to take good care of a rabbit.</p>

<p>Other things were on the table too, things so strange that
only a wondrous wise man would know how to use them; rings
and hoops and balls and bottles and a deck of cards big enough
for a giant to play with. They were all reflected in the mirror
so that, for every one, there were really two, but Muffs could
see only the rabbit. She had forgotten the Guide who lay there
beside the cage with his tall hat askew. Mary and Tommy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
forgotten him too. They poked their fingers through the cage
to feel the rabbit’s velvety nose and then Tommy found an odd-looking
stick and poked that in too.</p>

<p>What happened then was so surprising that none of the
children ever, ever forgot it. The Guide gave one leap, all by
himself, and then clattered to the floor, leaving his hat and
glasses behind him. A small, flat piece of metal clattered after
him and knocked off one of his arms. Then he lay still and
turned quietly back into a stick.</p>

<p>The children were so busy watching him that, for a minute,
they didn’t look at the table but, when they did look, both
the rabbit and the cage were gone. They were gone! They
weren’t anywhere on the table. They weren’t on the floor. They
weren’t reflected in the Bramble Bush Man’s big mirror. They
simply weren’t anywhere!</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Tommy, looking first at the stick in his
hand and then at the stick in the mirror. After a little while
he said, “Gee!” again. It was all he could say.</p>

<p>Mary couldn’t say anything but Muffs found herself talking
all at once as if she would never stop.</p>

<p>“It’s a magic wand!” she cried. “We’ve really turned into
story book people. We’re not real and the rabbit wasn’t real
and I don’t b’lieve even the house is real. But we can make
things real again with the wand. Touch something else,
Tommy, and see what happens.”</p>

<p>“Aw, you touch something,” he said, handing her the stick
as if he were glad to get rid of it.</p>

<p>“What shall I touch?” she asked, circling around the
room. Nothing in it seemed very solid and she had never outgrown
her fear of breaking things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
“Try this,” suggested Mary, pointing to a large vase of
flowers that stood on an equally large stand. “Maybe you can
change them into gold the way King Midas did in the story.”</p>

<p>“I’d love golden roses,” Muffs said softly. She had a feeling
that she was acting on a stage and that those three reflections
were really watching her. Even the floor felt wabbly. It was
more like a stage than ever when she played fairy princess and
reached out with her wand to touch the roses.</p>

<p>Then she forgot to act! It wasn’t a bit like a play any
more because something perfectly dreadful had happened.
Muffs had broken the vase! She hadn’t meant to break it. She
had only tapped it ever so gently but the moment the wand
touched it the whole bottom fell out. It left a great hole that
went right on through the stand and looked deep enough to go
through the floor too, through the floor and through the earth
until it came to China on the other side. Flowers, soil, everything
was swallowed up in this enormous hole. Muffs wanted to
crawl into the hole too and hide forever so that nobody would
ever know the awful thing she had done.</p>

<p>“You’ve broken it,” Mary was scolding her. Two Marys
were scolding her, the real Mary and the Mary in the looking-glass.
Two Tommys stood there big-eyed, staring at what was
left of two Guides with leafy fingers.</p>

<p>“I guess he wasn’t the Bramble Bush Man,” Tommy’s
voice said sorrowfully. “Let’s beat it before the real Bramble
Bush Man comes home.”</p>

<p>“But that wouldn’t be fair,” Muffs said and took one of
her curls to wipe away the tears that just would come. “He’ll
know anyway if he’s wondrous wise. I’ve got to fix it.”</p>

<p>She bent over the vase, trying to find the piece that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
fallen out. Was it something like this, she wondered, that had
sent her father to the ends of the earth? Muffs felt sure that
wise men could get very, very angry.</p>

<p>Just then a door opened somewhere. The children didn’t
stop to wonder where. They only heard the creak of its hinges,
the rattle of the knob and somebody’s big footsteps coming.</p>

<p>“It’s the Bramble Bush Man!” cried Muffs in a panic.</p>

<p>Tommy stuffed the glasses in his pocket and Muffs grabbed
the tall straw hat while Mary grabbed both their hands
and pulled them through the window. They didn’t turn their
heads to see the three frightened children in the Bramble Bush
Man’s big mirror. Sliding, falling, picking themselves up as
they ran, they never looked behind them until they stumbled
into a road.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PUBLIC_NOTICE" id="THE_PUBLIC_NOTICE"></a>THE PUBLIC NOTICE</h2>


<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Tommy, taking a breath. “Jiminey!
Where are we?”</p>

<p>They all looked about. There they were standing in the
middle of the big, dusty road right where it branched and went
on up Lookoff Mountain. At their left was the schoolhouse
with its shutters closed for the summer. At their right was the
grange hall where pie socials and spelling bees were sometimes
held. Beyond, the church raised its lofty steeple and behind
them was the Millionaire’s House, big and imposing as ever.
Nothing was different. The Bramble Bush Man’s queer little
house was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“You were right, Muffs. It wasn’t real,” said Tommy in
an awed whisper.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Mary. “It wasn’t. A real house couldn’t
disappear any more than a real rabbit could. But we’re real
again and I think it’s time we went home. Let’s take the short
cut.”</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, Muffs had looked inside the Guide’s
tall hat. She looked to see what made it so heavy and two
bright pink eyes looked back at her. Two long ears went back
and a soft nose twitched as much as to say, “You didn’t know
I was here, did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
“No, I didn’t,” said little Miss Muffet, just as if the rabbit
had really spoken.</p>

<p>“Didn’t what?” asked Tommy.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know there was a rabbit in the Indian Guide’s tall
hat.”</p>

<p>Mary looked and her dark eyes grew round as saucers.</p>

<div class="figcenter width335">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" width="335" height="273" alt="It’s the same
rabbit that disappeared in the Bramble Bush Man’s house!" />
</div>

<p>“Goodness Sakes Alive!” she exclaimed. “It’s the same
rabbit that disappeared in the Bramble Bush Man’s house!”</p>

<p>Tommy gave a whistle of surprise. “So it is! Gee willikins,
Muffs! How did it get there?”</p>

<p>“The same way we got here, I guess. Magic.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any such thing,” said Mary trying to be practical
but she might as well have said, “There isn’t any such
thing as air,” for it was all around them. First the glasses,
then the house and now the rabbit. Muffs stroked his silky ears
and they flattened down on his round little body so that he
looked like a soft white ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“I never had a pet,” she said. “You have your white cat,
Mary. And Tommy has Thomas Junior and now I have Bunny
Bright Eyes.”</p>

<p>“The name fits him,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Just the same you can’t keep him,” Mary declared. “The
Bramble Bush Man will know.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried. “I hope we never meet him. He’ll be
madder than ever if he thinks I stole his rabbit and we can’t
take it back when the house is gone.”</p>

<p>“I think we’re dreaming,” Tommy announced loud enough
to wake himself up if he had been.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the glasses,” suggested Mary. “Feel in your
pocket, Tommy, and see if you still have them.”</p>

<p>Yes, the glasses were there, their thick lenses looking more
like eyes than ever. It wasn’t nice, having the eyes of a wondrous
wise man watching everything the children did. They
made things look bigger. Even the naughty things they had
done that day looked much, much bigger through the glasses.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get rid of them,” Tommy confided.</p>

<p>“You should have left them in the Bramble Bush Man’s
house.”</p>

<p>“But, Mary, we couldn’t leave anything in the ghost of a
house,” said Tommy with a shiver. “I s’pose the Guide’s a
ghost by now and we’d have been ghosts too if we hadn’t run
away.” Then he turned to his new little playmate. “Muffs,
you’re from the city and know a lot. Why don’t you think of
something?”</p>

<p>So Muffs sat down on a curb stone, still holding the rabbit
carefully in the Guide’s tall hat. But all she could think of
was how angry the Bramble Bush Man would be when he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the broken vase and missed his rabbit. Then she thought of
Mr. and Mrs. Lippett and how they would scold her and wished
she were home in her own little bed instead of sitting on a cold
stone trying to think. Her bed was so warm and cozy and safe
behind the green and gold screen. Then the screen made her
think of her mother’s paintings and the paintings, strangely
enough, reminded her of signs. The rest was easy.</p>

<p>“We might put up a Public Notice,” she announced.</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“I know where!” Tommy cried excitedly. “On the walls
of the Post Office. Everybody comes in there after mail.”</p>

<p>Muffs thought she ought to hide the rabbit and stroked its
ears so that they would lay flat and not show over the brim of
the tall hat. People didn’t carry rabbits in hats when they
went to the Post Office.</p>

<p>The big doors were hard to swing open and Tommy was
just tall enough to reach the desk. He found a pen and first
he tried to write the Public Notice on one side of a blotter. The
ink all soaked in and it looked like shadow writing. Then he
tried the other side and wrote this:</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" width="500" height="315" alt="" />
<div class="caption">WE FOUND A PARE<br />
OF EYEZ IN A<br />
BRAMBLE BUSH<br />
<br />
IF YOUR WONDROUS<br />
WIZE PLEAZE CUM<br />
AND GET THEM
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
He stopped writing and held his pen in the air. Neither he
nor Miss Muffet noticed that it spattered a round spot of ink
on the back of her good dress.</p>

<p>When they reached the corner house, Tommy and Mary
ran on home and left Muffs to face the dragons alone. She
felt that Mr. and Mrs. Lippett had actually changed themselves
into two huge dragons with fire in their eyes. Both of them
were waiting on the porch. Both of them had deep scowl lines
in the center of their foreheads. When they saw Muffs’ dirty
face and torn dress with the big ink spot on the back the scowls
grew bigger but they didn’t say a word until Bunny Bright Eyes
poked his head out of the tall hat.</p>

<p>“Good land!” exclaimed Mrs. Lippett. “She’s got a rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Now where did that come from?” asked Mr. Lippett,
looking like a thundercloud.</p>

<p>Muffs’ face was burning red but for a moment she couldn’t
say a word. When she did speak it was only to stammer. “I&mdash;I
met some children&mdash;the Tyler children&mdash;and we went on a&mdash;a
<em>exposition</em>. They let me take their hat and this rabbit got
into it. None of us know how.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” the thundercloud exploded. “A little girl
doesn’t come home with a pet rabbit in her hat and not know
where she got it.”</p>

<p>“I think it belongs to someone,” Mrs. Lippett declared.
“You had better take it right back where you found it.”</p>

<p>“I found it in the hat,” Muffs insisted. “I thought maybe
it was magic.”</p>

<p>“A magic trick, that’s what,” roared Mr. Lippett. “But
you’ll see, young lady, that tricks don’t work in this house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
You’ll either get rid of that rabbit or find another place to board.
Now scoot!”</p>

<p>Muffs turned and ran as if the dragons were after her.
There was only one place she could go and that was back to
Tylers. She could see the light shining through their windows
and that helped guide her along the dark little road, over the
bridge and past the swamp that seemed to be filled with voices
calling:</p>

<p>“You cheat! You cheat! You cheat!”</p>

<p>“I am not a cheat!” Muffs called back to the frogs. “I
didn’t take the rabbit on purpose. So there!”</p>

<p>Muffs’ face was streaked with tears as well as dirt when she
finally rapped on the door. Mr. Tyler came to answer it.</p>

<p>“Please, mister, will you keep my rabbit?” she said, handing
him the hat, rabbit and all.</p>

<p>“Bless you!” he exclaimed. “Of course we’ll keep your
rabbit but first you must come in and tell us what’s the trouble.”</p>

<p>Muffs came in. Mary and Tommy and their big brother,
Donald, were seated around a table in the kitchen eating alphabet
soup. Mrs. Tyler was serving them from a steaming yellow
bowl and, when she had finished, she dished out another
serving for Muffs. “Come here to the basin,” she said, “and
wash away those tears. We can talk while your soup is cooling.”</p>

<p>That was all she said. She didn’t ask Muffs if she’d had
supper. She just seemed to know that the little girl was tired
and hungry and wanted nothing more than to sit down in someone’s
clean kitchen over a steaming bowl of alphabet soup.</p>

<p>Tommy was telling the day’s adventures while Thomas
Junior mewed about the table just as if he felt hurt that he had
been left out. Mary added to the story and soon Muffs joined
in and told about the rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Great Aunt Charlotte, who had finished supper long before,
sat in her chair rocking and holding baby Ellen. The
baby was asleep and would have been in bed if Mrs. Tyler
hadn’t been so interested in the story the children were telling.
Once she did say something about it being made up but Donald
defended them.</p>

<p>“One thing’s sure,” he said. “They didn’t make up the
rabbit.”</p>

<p>“I made up a name for him,” said Muffs. “It’s Bunny
Bright Eyes.”</p>

<p>“And a bright little rabbit he is too,” agreed Donald, “to
get inside the hat without your knowing it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lippett says I played a trick,” Muffs told him sorrowfully.
“But <em>I</em> wasn’t playing any trick. It was Bunny
Bright Eyes played a trick on me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler had to laugh at this, but Great Aunt Charlotte
kept looking at Muffins as if she were not telling the truth.
Mary and Tommy didn’t say anything because they were busy
eating the alphabet soup. Muffs ate her soup too and a little
while after that Mr. Tyler came in again.</p>

<p>“The rabbit’s all fixed up for the night,” he said. “I put
him in an A-coop until someone comes for him.”</p>

<p>Muffs wanted to ask what an A-coop was but just then it
was decided that Donald should go for her things and, if Mr.
and Mrs. Lippett were willing, make arrangements for her to
sleep all night with Mary.</p>

<p>“She’s far too tired to walk back there herself,” Mrs.
Tyler said. Then she showed Muffs the high bed where she
and Mary were to sleep and told her Mary would be up as soon
as she had finished drying the dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Muffs undressed herself quickly and slid between the
blankets. She lay there listening to the clatter of dishes downstairs
and thinking. At first she thought it was strange that
she had been sent to bed ahead of Mary. Then she thought
how tired she was and how warm the alphabet soup made her
feel. Maybe the letters spelled w-a-r-m down in her stomach.
They ought to spell s-l-e-e-p. The rabbit was probably asleep
now in his A-coop. What a funny name! Muffs made up a
little song about it and sung it to herself. The song went like
this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">A-coop, B-coop, could there be a C-coop?</div>
<div class="line">Could a rabbit in a C-coop</div>
<div class="line">See a little girl eating alphabet soup</div>
<div class="line">In an A-coop, B-coop, C-coop, D-coop ...</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">and so on clear through the alphabet.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a very sensible song but people don’t often think
sensible things when they’re almost asleep. All night long
Muffs dreamed about her mother. They went shopping together
on the subway the way they often did at home. How
she loved that! She would scramble for the front train so
that she could look out of the window and play she was flying.
There were all the colored lights along the tracks. They flashed
green, telling the train to go; then big and red, telling the train
to stop.</p>

<p>Muffs sat up in bed. That big red light wasn’t a stop light
at all. It was shining right in her eyes. Opening her mouth,
she screamed, “Fire!” and was going to scream it again but
Tommy clapped his hand over her lips and she could only
whisper, “What’s the matter?” through his fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
<img src="images/p09.jpg" width="500" height="387" alt="Tommy clapped his hand over her lips" />
</div>

<p>“The Public Notice. It’s got to have our names on it or
the Bramble Bush Man won’t know where to come for his glasses.
Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Muffs didn’t see very well because she was too sleepy.
Besides, the lantern Tommy was holding blinded her and she
couldn’t quite get over the feeling that it was really a fire.
Mary, who had somehow managed to creep into bed without
disturbing Muffs, was now asleep herself and even Tommy’s
Shaking wouldn’t rouse her.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Mary! Come on, Muffs!” Tommy was calling
in an excited voice. “We could fix it up now and get back
before anyone missed us in the morning.”</p>

<p>Mary turned over in the bed and didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“Take that light out of my eyes,” said Muffs. “I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
having such a nice dream about the cars when you woke me up.
My mother sold some of her pictures and we were spending the
money for hats and dresses and dolls&mdash;and&mdash;carriages&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But Muffs! We’ve got to fix up the public notice,” cried
Tommy. “We’ve got to put in about the rabbit too or it
wouldn’t be fair.”</p>

<p>“He’s asleep&mdash;in an A-coop. What’s an A-coop, Tommy?”</p>

<p>But Muffs went back to sleep while he was telling her and
didn’t know the answer until morning. Mrs. Tyler’s voice calling
Tommy sounded dimly through her dreams but at first she
thought it was only her mother talking to someone in the studio.
She reached out to touch the green and gold screen but her
hand found only empty air.</p>

<p>“Someone must have taken the screen away,” she thought
sleepily. The room looked big and empty without it. Her
heart felt empty too when she heard the voice again and knew
it was not her mother at all. It was Mrs. Tyler and she kept
calling:</p>

<p>“Tom-mee! Tom-mee!”</p>

<p>An echo came back from the big barn door and soon Muffs
and Mary were both wide awake. Mary’s clothes were ready
and she dressed herself quickly but Muffs had to hunt for hers
in the suitcase Donald must have brought in while she was
sleeping. She found a pair of green socks and a blue linen dress
that was a little wrinkled from being packed so long. Her
clothes weren’t like that at home. They were kept on hangers
in neat little rows and her mother always told her what to put
on. Mrs. Tyler didn’t tell her. She just kept on calling
Tommy.</p>

<p>“He’s a bad boy not to answer,” said Mary impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Muffs had a feeling that something had happened to him
in the night but she couldn’t remember what it was. Together,
she and Mary went over to the window and looked out. There
was Mrs. Tyler walking toward the barn still looking for Tommy.
Right beside the barn was what Muffs knew must be the A-coop
because a dear little white rabbit was jumping about inside of it.</p>

<p>“They call it an A-coop because it’s in the shape of an A,”
Mary explained, “only there are too many bars across it.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” Muffs agreed. “Bunny Bright Eyes must
feel as if he’s in prison. Let’s go down and talk to him.”</p>

<p>When they were halfway there they met Mrs. Tyler and
her eyes were red as if she had been crying.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Tommy?” she asked.</p>

<p>Muffs tried harder than ever to remember what had happened
in the night. He had come into her room and whispered
something. It must have been something about a fire.</p>

<p>“I think,” the little girl said in a voice that didn’t sound
sure, “I think that he went to see a fire.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler put her hand to her heart. “Don’t tell me,
child! Whatever makes you think that?”</p>

<p>So Miss Muffet told what she remembered of Tommy’s visit
to their room in the night.</p>

<p>“Were you asleep, Mary?” her mother asked.</p>

<p>Mary said she was. “But I woke up early,” she went on,
“before it was time to get up and I did see Tommy through my
front bedroom window. I’m sure it was Tommy. I could just
see him through the trees and he was running along the big road
so fast I thought he must be going to see a fire.”</p>

<p>“But he would have told us&mdash;” his mother started to say.</p>

<p>“Not if he thought you wouldn’t let him go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
“He’s a good boy, Mary,” said Mrs. Tyler and all at once
she was crying again and saying between sobs, “Suppose he’s
been hurt! Oh, my poor little boy!”</p>

<p>Mary went over and put her arm around her mother and
pressed her own cheek against that other cheek where the tears
were.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Mom,” she said. “We’ll go and get him.
Maybe he’s still watching the fire.”</p>

<p>“You are a comfort,” said Mrs. Tyler. “Maybe you know
what you’re talking about after all. Tommy’s gone and he must
have gone somewhere. It wouldn’t do any harm to walk down
the road a bit and ask about fires.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FIRE_THAT_WAS" id="THE_FIRE_THAT_WAS"></a>THE FIRE THAT WAS</h2>


<p>Muffs tried to remember something about the Public Notice.
It was something important that she should have remembered
before. Tommy had told her. He had told her in the
middle of the night when she was too sleepy to listen. Now,
after she had mixed things up and frightened everybody, she
remembered all about it. She had told Mrs. Tyler that Tommy
went to see a fire when it wasn’t a fire at all but only his lantern
shining in her face. He had really gone to the Post Office to fix
up the Public Notice before people came for their mail. He
hadn’t hurried right back the way he said he would and, with
things appearing and disappearing the way they did, something
terrible might have happened to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” thought Muffs. “What a perfectly
awful mess! What am I going to do?”</p>

<p>She looked at the side of Mrs. Tyler’s face and wished that
she would smile. Maybe she’d dare tell her then. She looked
at Mary, walking along on the other side of her mother, and
knew she couldn’t tell her either. Mary would argue and Mrs.
Tyler would never believe that she had forgotten. It would be
like her story about the rabbit. She guessed nobody ever would
believe what she said any more. After that queer expedition to
the ends of the earth she and Mary and Tommy (if they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
him) would be like three children in a fairy tale. Only it was
easier for Mary because she wasn’t afraid to argue with
grown-ups.</p>

<p>New York and her own mother seemed very far away to
Muffs as she hurried along the road, trying to match her small
steps to Mary’s and Mrs. Tyler’s. She felt the way she had done
when she broke the vase and when Mr. and Mrs. Lippett scolded
her for having Bunny Bright Eyes in her hat. Little girls were
supposed to know so much when they were away from home.
And it was hard to tell dreams from real things, especially when
the real things were stranger than the dreams.</p>

<p>“We might&mdash;we might just look for Tommy in the Post
Office,” Muffs suggested timidly as they turned onto the big road.</p>

<p>“Why the Post Office?” Mrs. Tyler asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe&mdash;there wasn’t a fire. Maybe he really went to the
Post Office to fix up the Public Notice.”</p>

<p>“But you said he went to see a fire.”</p>

<p>“I thought he did&mdash;and then I remembered he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You mean you made up what you told me about the fire?”
demanded Mrs. Tyler.</p>

<p>Muffs nodded. She didn’t think it would do any good to
keep on saying she thought it was true at first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler’s-lips went into a straight line. “What is this
Public Notice?” she asked. “It must have been dreadfully important
that Tommy should get up in the middle of the night
and go to fix it.”</p>

<p>“It was dreadf’ly important,” Muffs declared. “He had to
get there before people came for their mail. You see, we put
up the notice and forgot to write our names on it.”</p>

<p>“Did we?” exclaimed Mary. “That’s so,” she remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
“We did. Then that must be where Tommy went. He
was running just as if he had forgotten something dreadfully
important.”</p>

<p>The Public Notice was all fixed up when they looked for
it in the Post Office. It had the three names on it:</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" width="500" height="36" alt="" />
<div class="caption">M. MUFFET &nbsp;&nbsp; T. TYLER  &nbsp;&nbsp; M. TYLER.</div>
</div>

<p>There was also a P. S. about Bunny Bright Eyes:</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" width="500" height="67" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
IF ENNYONE LOST A RABBiT<br />
WE FOUND HiM IN THE GIDEZ HAT.</div>
</div>

<p>But there was no sign of Tommy.</p>

<p>Farther up the road were shops and stores and the grange
hall. Tommy might be playing there. Or possibly in the school
yard or along the road that went up Lookoff Mountain. The
air was misty and smelled queer but Muffs wouldn’t let herself
think of fires any more. Tommy was lost and it was partly her
fault that Mary looked so serious and Mrs. Tyler so worried.</p>

<p>Then they came in sight of the tailor shop, or what had
been the tailor shop. The queer, crooked smokestack wasn’t
there any more and the roof had a gaping hole right through
the shingles. Just about all the children in the valley were
crowded around and among them was Tommy.</p>

<p>“I saw you!” he cried, and came running toward them.
“Where were you going?”</p>

<p>“Looking for you,” his mother answered. “Tommy!
Tommy! What happened to you?”</p>

<p>“I was watching the fire.”</p>

<p>“The fire! What fire?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
“The tailor shop fire. I turned in the alarm,” said the little
boy proudly.</p>

<p>Muffs was speechless except for one excited squeal.
Things were growing queerer and queerer. Here she had told
a story that she thought was true and just when she remembered
that it was only a story, up bobs Tommy saying that he has
been to see a fire after all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler drew him closer to her. “You brave boy!” she
said. “Tell me how you knew.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” he answered. “I smelled something burning.
You know how it smells when you forget the iron and
leave it on the board too long. Well, it smelled like that only
worse and pretty soon I saw some smoke coming out of the roof
of the tailor shop. I waked up the grocer and the man in the
gas station and we stayed to help fight the fire. I guess you’d
want to help fight a fire if you had turned in the alarm your very
own self and everybody thought you were a hero.”</p>

<p>“I guess I would,” his mother agreed and patted his
shoulder.</p>

<p>It was all a little confusing and she was anxious to hear
more about the Public Notice so Tommy told her about the
glasses and how they had found them in the woods and put them
on the Guide’s twig nose. He took them out of his pocket to
show her and she agreed that someone might need them badly.</p>

<p>“Everything would have been all right,” she said, “if Muffs
hadn’t said you went to see a fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, he did, didn’t he?” Mary asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Muffs didn’t know it. She had us all worried
with her story of lights and cars and fires. I didn’t know <em>what</em>
to make of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
“I’m sorry, Mom,” said Tommy. “I guess I scared her
with my lantern shining in her eyes. She went back to sleep
while I was talking and prob’ly dreamed part of it. Don’t you
s’pose we could go back and just let Muffs and Mary see where
the fire was? It’s all been burned black inside and it’s wet from
the pails of water and shines like anybody’s new shoes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler laughed. “I guess we could. I’ll tell your
father and Donald that you’re safe. I had them out hunting
for you. Then I’ll stop in at the Lippett’s. There was something
I wanted to talk over with them&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mom! Couldn’t we play around where the fire was
while you talk?”</p>

<p>Muffs was afraid to coax. She couldn’t believe it was true
until she saw Mrs. Tyler walking on down the road. She had
left them to play alone.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HEADLESS_MAN" id="THE_HEADLESS_MAN"></a>THE HEADLESS MAN</h2>


<p>The burned tailor shop had stopped smoking but there was
still a crowd around the ruins and the queer little tailor was
still hopping about and talking of his loss. He was a thin man
with big glasses and very bushy hair. It stood straight up under
his hat and looked almost like the splints on the broom that
Tommy had made into a make-believe tailor. Tommy and Muffs
and Mary edged closer to hear what he was saying.</p>

<p>“Twenty pair of pants!” he said sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“What’s he talking about?” Tommy asked an older boy.</p>

<p>The boy grinned. “Twenty pair of pants.”</p>

<p>“We heard that. But what about them?”</p>

<p>“He burned them up,” answered the boy. Then he looked
at Tommy. “Sa-ay! Aren’t you the fellow who turned in the
alarm? Come and I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>So the big boy led the way through the ruins of the tailor
shop. It wasn’t very safe but nobody was paying any attention
to that. Muffs touched the blackened wood as they passed and
thought of the charcoal that her mother used to draw pictures
with. She broke off a piece and drew a picture on the back of
the big boy’s white shirt.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Mary. She kicked something hard
that lay on the burned place where the floor boards used to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“It’s his iron!” exclaimed Tommy. “I’d like to bet that’s
what started the fire.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" width="500" height="439" alt="She kicked something hard
that lay on the burned place where the floor boards used to be." />
</div>

<p>He picked it up and ran outside to show the tailor but the
tailor had gone. Everybody had gone except a few children
who took turns holding the iron to see how heavy it was. It was
pretty heavy for any of them to carry but Muffs had an idea.
She took off the hair ribbon that she was wearing Alice-in-Wonderland
style about her head and tied one end of it through
the holes in the iron where the handle, if it hadn’t burned up,
was supposed to go.</p>

<p>“Now it’s a duck,” she said. “It’s Fannie Flatbreast.”</p>

<p>She pulled the duck about the ruins of the tailor shop and
its flat breast sounded clank! clank! whenever they went over a
crack.</p>

<p>The next discovery was an old broom. It was made of
fibre and only a part of it had burned. The red strings that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
bound the fibres together looked even more like a mouth than
the strings on Tommy’s broom in the workshop. The Bramble
Bush Man’s glasses provided eyes and made the creature look
wondrous wise as well. Tommy hid himself behind the broom
and made believe it was the tailor. He was hopping around,
nodding his head and explaining the fire to a group of play customers
when along came a real customer. He stood still for a
moment, then muttered something to himself and turned to go
away.</p>

<p>“Look at him!” called all the children. Several of them
pointed their fingers at his back with oh’s and ah’s of surprise.
Muffs skated to the burned door of the shop with Fannie Flatbreast
and what she saw was the strangest sight on earth.</p>

<p>“Why, he hasn’t any head,” she squealed. “He hasn’t
any, any, any, any head!”</p>

<div class="figcenter width800">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" width="800" height="391" alt="“Look at him!” called all the children." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
The other children laughed and squealed too and before
long they had all caught up her song and were calling at the
top of their voices: “He hasn’t any, any, any, any head! He
must be a ghost! He must be a giant! He must be the Headless
Horseman of Sleepy Hollow! He hasn’t any, any, any, any
head!”</p>

<p>“He has so!” cried Mary. “He’s only covering it up with
that coat on a hanger!”</p>

<p>“He’s a fake!” shouted Tommy and started running after
him, waving the scary-looking broom-tailor. The other children
followed. They were all laughing and shouting. None of them
stopped to think how they would feel if they came with a coat
to be cleaned or mended and found the tailor shop burned down.
They didn’t know how heavy the coat was or how far the man
had carried it held above his shoulders on a hanger. Of course
they knew it was only a coat on a hanger and that he was holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
it above his shoulders. But it looked so queer! And it
was such fun to chase him and play he was a headless man.</p>

<p>Other children joined the chase until there were more than
a dozen. Older people looked out of windows and stopped in
the road wondering what the noise was all about. A dog set up
a furious barking. But still the children kept on running.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” called Muffs and Mary and Tommy.</p>

<p>The headless man did not answer. He ran and ran and
ran until at last he turned in at the Millionaire’s House. He
slammed the door shut and left the children still singing outside.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any, any, any, any head! He must be the
Headless Horseman&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He must be somebody important to live in a house like
that,” Muffs interrupted them in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Then they all stood still and looked up at the house. It
was the same one that used to belong to old Mr. Pendleton and
he had sold it. Nobody knew who lived there now but, whoever
it was, he must be another millionaire. On the top floor of his
house was one room all of glass and filled with flowers.</p>

<p>“Maybe he got rich selling flowers for funerals,” Muffs
suggested.</p>

<p>“I think he’s a miser,” said Mary. “He probably sits upstairs
all day counting his money.”</p>

<p>“I wish we knew what his face looks like,” Tommy put in.
“Muffs, I dare you to walk up on his front porch and ring the
doorbell.”</p>

<p>“I dare you! I dare you!” shouted all the other children,
jumping up and down and clapping their hands.</p>

<p>So Muffs marched straight up to the door and rang the bell.
She was laughing and panting because she was out of breath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
But she stopped laughing when the headless man opened the
door and she saw his face. He was very, very angry.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ringing my bell?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I just wanted to see what you looked like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve seen,” he said and was about to slam the
door when Tommy darted in and planted his sturdy little body
between Muffs and the headless man.</p>

<p>“She’s not used to having doors slammed in her face,” he
said. “Besides, she’s really a princess doomed to live with a
couple of dragons who are mean to her and I think it’s about
time someone treated her like royalty.”</p>

<p>The man looked surprised for a moment. His face was
a nice face and his eyes looked as if they might twinkle when he
wasn’t so angry.</p>

<p>“Princesses don’t chase strangers through the public
highways,” he said. “Princes don’t either. So get out!” and
the door closed with a bang.</p>

<p>“Aw, heck!” muttered the older boy with the picture on
the back of his shirt, “he would have to be a sore head and spoil
all the fun.”</p>

<p>“He can’t be a sore head,” sang out contrary Mary, “if he
hasn’t any, any, any, any head!”</p>

<p>Other voices joined her and the children were singing
again. Tommy waved the tailor, and Muffs swung Fannie Flatbreast
on her ribbon. The others took hold of hands and paraded
back and forth across the grass on the man’s neatly trimmed
lawn. They jumped over his hedge and broke off pieces of
shrubbery to wave like flags as they sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">“Headless man! Headless man!</div>
<div class="line">Come and catch us if you can!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
The boy who had made up this new and still more tantalizing
song banged on the door with a piece of primrose tree.</p>

<p>“You’ll break the glass!” cried Muffs in a fright. “Come
away and leave him alone. Maybe he’s got a headache.”</p>

<p>“He can’t have a headache! He hasn’t any, any, any, any
head!” called all the children. “Headless man! Headless
man! Come and catch us&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’ll catch you and wring your necks,” he cried, bursting
open the door. He had a stick in his hand and shook it at them
as he shouted, “Get out of here! I’ve had enough of children.
It’s a pity a man can’t have peace in his own house what with
children banging on doors and breaking in windows&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did someone break in his window?” asked one of the
older boys, looking a little frightened.</p>

<p>“He’ll get us in trouble yet,” said another as the group
scattered.</p>

<p>“Go on home!” the headless man was shouting. “Go on
home to your mothers, every last one of you!”</p>

<p>“I can’t go home to mine,” Muffs said sadly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” the man demanded. He came right down
the steps to look at her as if he had seen her somewhere before
and wanted to remember.</p>

<p>“I can’t go home because my mother’s in New York and
I’m here,” the child replied. “That’s why.”</p>

<p>“She ought to take better care of you,” snapped the headless
man as Muffs turned and ran with the others. Tommy
was ahead. He was still waving the broom and shouting but
Muffs’ flat-iron duck had grown heavy and hard to pull.</p>

<p>“Tommy! Tommy!” she called after him. “Don’t run
so fast! I can’t keep up with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
So Tommy turned around and the Tailor turned around
and, for the first time, the headless man saw that he was wearing
glasses. The bows were hooked securely to his fibre ears,
giving him the appearance of a creature half-man, half-cat.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” he shouted. “Whose glasses are you
carrying around on that ridiculous-looking broom?”</p>

<p>“Whose glasses!” gasped Tommy, stopping for breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, mister,” Muffs put in, “I’m sure they’re not yours.
They belong to a wondrous wise man and we’re keeping them
until he comes for them.”</p>

<p>“So!” snorted the headless man and looked angrier than
ever. “I’m sure no wondrous wise man would trust his glasses
to a gang of reckless children.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why he shouldn’t,” Muffs replied.</p>

<p>“Humph! Wise men have more to do than chase around
after children.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you know about wise men?” Mary asked.
She had a way of making people feel uncomfortable and the
headless man must have felt very uncomfortable then. He
pulled his coat collar up around his neck and walked away.</p>

<p>“Headless man!” said Tommy under his breath. “Gee!
He looks like a headless man with that collar turned up.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said Mary, “he lost his head. That’s what
Great Aunt Charlotte tells me I do when I’m angry.”</p>

<p>Muffs’ face clouded. “I guess that’s what Mrs. Lippett
will do when she hears about this. She’s sure to hear ’cause
everybody saw us running with the Tailor and I’d rather go right
into a dragon’s cave than go back there alone.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go with you,” Tommy offered.</p>

<p>Mary thought it wouldn’t be wise to take the Tailor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Fannie Flatbreast so, after many fond goodbyes, they were left
in the ruins of the tailor shop. Muffs’ ribbon was left there too,
but all the children carried home tell-tale smudges on their
hands and faces.</p>

<p>When they neared the corner house they saw there was
reason for going in together for Mrs. Tyler and Donald were
both standing on the porch talking with Mrs. Lippett.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s about time&mdash;” Mrs. Lippett began but, because
of something that was felt rather than said, she waited and let
the children explain. Their reasons for chasing the headless
man sounded funny to Donald. He had seen them running with
the scary-looking broom and had, though he did not confess it
until later, cheered them and whistled. Mrs. Tyler, however,
was grave and Mrs. Lippett red-faced and angry. She scolded.
She complained because the check Muffs’ mother had sent for
her board was smaller than she thought it ought to be.</p>

<p>“With all this trouble,” she declared, “it’s worth twice
what Mrs. Moffet gives me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you don’t understand children,” Mrs. Tyler suggested.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand this one. The Lord knows I’d be
grateful if someone would take her off my hands.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we?” Mary whispered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tyler looked very stern. “Do you really think, Mary,
that you and Muffs and Tommy should be rewarded for acting
like little hoodlums instead of well-behaved children?”</p>

<p>“But, Mom&mdash;” Donald began. “You told Mrs. Lippett&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I told her,” Mrs. Tyler stopped him.
“The fact remains that the children have been very thoughtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and very unkind. They must be made to realize that such a
thing must never happen again.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we’d never chase the headless man again, would
we?” Mary asked and Muffs and Tommy agreed that they never
would.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Tommy said grandly, “we left the broom and
the flat-iron in the tailor shop and it’s a buried city as far as
we’re concerned.”</p>

<p>“Let’s bury the whole thing and go home,” Donald suggested.</p>

<p>So they went home together&mdash;Mrs. Tyler, Donald, Mary,
Tommy and Muffs who knew for sure now that she wouldn’t have
to go back to Lippetts and face the dragons alone. When Mr.
Tyler heard about it he only laughed and said, “Children will be
children.” Baby Ellen waved her arms about and called
“How-do” to Muffins. Even Great Aunt Charlotte gave her
pink peppermints and the sun came out and shone all afternoon.</p>

Bunny Bright Eyes was sitting like a prisoner in the dark little A-coop. " />
</div>

<p>All this time Bunny Bright Eyes was sitting like a prisoner
in the dark little A-coop. Muffs was the first one to remember
him. She and Mary and Tommy ran across the yard and out
into Mrs. Tyler’s garden. They brought lettuce and carrots and
spinach leaves to hold in their hands while the rabbit nosed
through the bars and ate.</p>

<p>It was fun to watch him eat. But it was more fun when
they let him out of the coop and he followed them over the
grass. At first they watched him very carefully for fear that
he would run away or one of the cats would get him although
Mary and Tommy felt perfectly sure that neither Tabby nor
Thomas Junior would harm an innocent little white bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Before long they learned that Bunny Bright Eyes would
come into the Guide’s tall hat just the way a canary bird comes
into a cage. Some one had trained him and the children felt
sure it was the Bramble Bush Man. They played right close
to the house and kept watch for him.</p>

<p>After a week had passed without anyone coming for Bunny
Bright Eyes, Muffs began to think maybe he was hers to keep.
She and Mary and Tommy were playing Bunny Tag around the
A-coop. Bunny Tag was a new game they had made up themselves.
You couldn’t be tagged if you were hopping like a
bunny. Baby Ellen, who could creep far better than she could
walk, enjoyed the game and Bunny Bright Eyes played and
never was tagged at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p14a.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="Baby Ellen
enjoyed the game." title="" />
</div>

<p>“I think we ought to give him a prize,” announced Tommy.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any,” Mary objected, but Tommy wouldn’t
say anything. He just looked mysterious and later they heard
him talking with Donald about taking a trip to Balo.</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” Muffs asked.</p>

<p>So Mary told her about the secret charm Tommy had made
up a long time ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
“He plays Balo is another world and the walk that we call
the Way of Peril is a path of light.”</p>

<p>“And it’s really only the carpenter shop?” asked Muffs.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you mustn’t breathe a word because you’re supposed
to believe it else it won’t come true.”</p>

<p>“I’ll believe it,” said Muffs.</p>

<p>“Then shut your eyes and keep on believing.”</p>

<p>Muffs shut her eyes and believed as hard as she could.
Soon she began to see things that looked like shooting stars behind
her eyelids.</p>

<p>“Could we ride there on a shooting star?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll try it,” said Mary and, taking her hand, led her
carefully along the walk.</p>

<p>“This is our own private magic,” she said. “Now you’re
a Magic Maker too.”</p>

<p>Before they were halfway across the Way of Peril they
heard the tap-tapping of a hammer pounding something.</p>

<p>“That’s the Hammer Headed Snake welcoming us to the
Land of Balo. May we come in?” Mary called.</p>

<p>“Maybe it wasn’t a welcome,” Muffs said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“May we come in?” Mary called more loudly through the
door and Tommy swung it open.</p>

<p>“Spies!” he shouted. “Spying on Bunny’s prize.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean to spy,” said Mary penitently. “We
came quite properly on a shooting star.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like a declaration of war to me,” observed
Donald with a fierce scowl. He was nailing something while
Tommy stood with a bunch of nails in his hand, giving them to
Donald one by one. There on the bench beside them was the
dearest little house Muffs had ever seen. It was even nicer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
than the doll houses in New York stores at Christmas time.</p>

<p>“The people of Balo made it,” Tommy said proudly.</p>

<p>“With us to help, of course,” Donald added. “It’s a prize
for Bunny Bright Eyes. Think he’ll like it better than the
A-coop?”</p>

<p>“He’ll <em>love</em> it,” cried Muffs. “Look, Mary! Don’t you
love it too?”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have come if we’d known it was such a nice
surprise,” she said. “I guess we spoiled it.”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot,” laughed Donald, forgetting his declaration
of war. “Now you can help too. Tommy hurried things
up a lot by sawing off pieces of wood and holding the hammer
and nails. I made a bird house this Spring and this is made the
same way only bigger. Of course,” he went on with some pride,
“I had to fix the roof so that half of it goes back on hinges.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Muffs, admiring it, “that’s so we can put Bunny
Bright Eyes in.”</p>

<p>“And this chicken wire,” Donald continued, showing her
how carefully he had nailed it, “is so he can see out.”</p>

<p>Muffs thought of the funny little rhyme she had made up
and told it to him.</p>

<p>“There could be a C-coop after all,” she said. “This house
must be a C-coop ’cause Bunny can see out.”</p>

<p>“And because you sneaked in to <em>see</em> it,” added Donald
with a laugh. He had finished nailing on the roof and now he
was carefully cutting out a round window in the peak. When
that was done he announced that the house was all finished but
the paint. “Here’s green for the roof and red for the house,”
he continued, taking down two paint pails from a shelf above
the work-bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Tommy noticed the dim outline of the chalk faces he had
once painted on them when they stood guard over the gates of
the City of Balo. He knelt before them.</p>

<p>“Oh, knights in tin armor,” he pleaded. “Your humble
servants desire some of your blood.”</p>

<p>Mary found three brushes in a rack on the wall and the
Sawhorse lent his brushy tail so that there were enough to go
around. Soon everybody was spattering paint on Bunny’s
house. Muffs painted the right side. Mary painted the left
side while Tommy did the back and Donald the roof.</p>

<p>“Guess Bunny Bright Eyes will think this is a palace after
that dirty A-coop,” he said.</p>

<p>“How long will it take to dry?” Muffs asked.</p>

<p>“Not more’n a day. Better give Bunny a farewell feast.
He’ll be moving into his new house tomorrow.”</p>

<p>So Muffs and Mary and Tommy started toward the garden
while Donald, careful to do as his father had told him, stayed to
clean up the brushes. The garden was at the right of the house
and a little nearer than the barn and the A-coop where the children
supposed Bunny was waiting for his very special feast.
They picked only the young vegetables because they tasted
sweeter and then ran down hill to surprise him.</p>

<p>“Bunny!” Muffs called softly. “Bunny Bright Eyes!”</p>

<p>The little rabbit did not hop up to the bars of his coop as
she had expected.</p>

<p>“He must be asleep,” Mary said, and called a little louder.</p>

<p>“He isn’t there!” exclaimed Tommy going nearer to the
A-coop and looking in. “Muffs, you promised to put him back
the last time we played Bunny Tag.”</p>

<p>“I did put him back. I know I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
“Then Mom must have taken him out,” said Tommy.
“Let’s go in the house and see.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width488">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" width="488" height="387" alt="Muffs and Mary lifted their dresses high because they were
full of lettuce and spinach leaves." />
</div>

<p>Muffs and Mary lifted their dresses high because they were
full of lettuce and spinach leaves. Tommy held his hands
straight out at his sides dangling yellow carrots. Mrs. Tyler
was sitting at the kitchen table peeling potatoes when they entered
the house. She looked up.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve gathered lettuce for dinner,” she exclaimed.
“How nice of you to think of it.”</p>

<p>Muffs emptied the lettuce into a pan without a word.</p>

<p>“And carrots,” Mrs. Tyler went on, taking them from
Tommy’s hands. “How young they are! Almost too young to
cook, but I guess we can eat them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
“Mom, where’s Bunny Bright Eyes?” Mary asked.</p>

<p>“A man came for him.” She stopped speaking when she
saw the blank way that the children were looking at her.</p>

<p>“Who was the man?” they asked.</p>

<p>“He didn’t give his name. He asked about the glasses but
I’d forgotten where you put them. I called and called.”</p>

<p>“We were in the workshop.”</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t say, “painting a house for Bunny Bright
Eyes.” He felt there was no need of saying that. His mother
would say the children were foolish to plan on keeping the
rabbit. She would be right too. But what a shame that they
had missed seeing the Bramble Bush Man!</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll come for his glasses another time and we can
see him,” Mary said hopefully.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see him,” sobbed Muffs. “He’s taken
Bunny Bright Eyes.”</p>

<p>For days after that Muffs was very quiet, refusing to play
and half the time refusing to talk. Then, one morning, she
borrowed Mary’s pencil and paper and went out into the workshop
alone.</p>

<p>“She’s walking the Way of Peril,” Mary whispered.
“She’s like you used to be, Tommy. She’d rather be alone in
the Land of Balo.”</p>

<p>“She’s got a secret then,” he declared. “People always
want to be alone when they’ve got secrets. Let’s wait here and
see if she won’t tell us when she comes out.”</p>

<p>So they waited on the One Way Steps. It was nearly noon
when Muffs came out of the workshop. She was walking along
the Way of Peril, holding the paper in one hand and a post card
in the other and smiling to herself.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
<img src="images/p16.jpg" width="500" height="594" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PUT THE EDGE OF THE CARD HERE<br />
AND HERE<br />
NOW PUT YOUR NOZE DOWN<br />
ON THE OTHER EDGE<br />
AND LOOK!</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
“Wait a minute!” called Mary. “Can’t we see it too?”</p>

<p>Muffs turned around in surprise and held out the paper.
“Look!” she cried. “I’ve made him come back again. I’ve
made Bunny Bright Eyes go into his little house!”</p>

<p>On the paper was the picture she had drawn, first the house
and then a rabbit that looked for all the world like Bunny Bright
Eyes.</p>

<p>“But he isn’t in the house,” Mary objected.</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em> he is,” said Muffs and, placing the edge of the post
card between the rabbit and the house, she bent closer and
looked. Tommy looked too. At first the rabbit didn’t go all
the way in, but when he looked a little closer, sure enough, there
he was inside his own little house. He sat there behind the wire
screen until Tommy took the card away.</p>

<p>“It’s magic,” said Mary. She helped Muffs print directions
so that other people could work the magic too.</p>

<p>But to Muffs it was more than magic. Whenever she
longed to see Bunny Bright Eyes, she could look at the paper
bunny and play he was real. She could even forgive the Bramble
Bush Man for taking the real bunny away.</p>

<h2><a name="CAKES_AND_TEA" id="CAKES_AND_TEA"></a>CAKES AND TEA</h2>


<p>As time passed the children became more and more determined
that they must see the Bramble Bush Man. Tommy often
spoke of it and blamed himself for forgetting the Guide.</p>

<p>“We could have a <em>play</em> Bramble Bush Man anyway,” he
said, “if I hadn’t been so scared. We could play he was wondrous
wise and make him answer important questions.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t answer anything we didn’t know ourselves,”
said Mary.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t tell me where the ends of the earth are,”
Muffs put in. “Besides, the man that came for the glasses was
real because your mother saw him.”</p>

<p>“He’ll come again,” said Mary hopefully and whenever
anyone came to the door they ran to see who it was. Once,
when they were playing in the front yard, Muffs saw a man coming
up the road and felt sure it was the Bramble Bush Man. She
ran towards him, eager to make friends, and bumped into&mdash;not
the Bramble Bush Man at all, but the cranky headless man.</p>

<p>“’Scuse me!” she murmured and ran back to tell Mary
and Tommy. “He’s coming to put us in jail! Quick! Hide
somewhere!”</p>

<p>They were darting this way and that looking for a safe
place when the headless man turned right into the yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
“Where’s your mother?” he called out. “I want to see
her.”</p>

<p>Muffs, who was really braver than she supposed she was,
crawled out from a good hiding place she had just discovered
underneath the porch.</p>

<p>“I told you,” she said simply. “My mother is in New
York.”</p>

<p>“His mother then,” he demanded, pointing to Tommy.</p>

<p>“She’s letting me board here,” Muffs explained. “She
went shopping.”</p>

<p>The headless man was losing his temper again. He turned
to Mary who had just emerged, dirty and looking rather ashamed,
from underneath the A-coop.</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother? I’ve got to see somebody.”</p>

<p>“My mother’s the same as Tommy’s mother,” Mary said.
“But if you must see somebody I think Daddy’s home. He’s
working out in that house at the end of the walk. It’s his carpenter
shop.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him later. What were you doing in there?” he
asked, scowling at the A-coop.</p>

<p>“Hiding,” Mary confessed. “That’s where we used to
keep Bunny Bright Eyes. He was a rabbit. The man that
owned him came and got him while we were busy making him a
house.”</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Muffs, holding up the picture she had
drawn. “This is the house and if you know the trick you can
make Bunny Bright Eyes hop right into it.”</p>

<p>“Who drew that picture?” demanded the headless man.</p>

<p>“I did. I did it so I wouldn’t miss him so&mdash;I mean the
rabbit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
“Who taught you how to draw like that?”</p>

<p>“My mother. She’s an artist,” Muffs added proudly.
“She sent me here while she goes to school.”</p>

<p>“Your mother goes to school?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Art school so she can sell her pictures and we can
move some place else ’cause it’s such a little place and the landlady
doesn’t like children.”</p>

<p>“I see. I see. And so you were making the rabbit a
house&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Donald, that’s my big brother, made it,” Mary spoke up.
“He made it out in the workshop. We call it the Land of Balo.
The paint pails came to life and gave us their blood to paint it
with. We made a stick come to life too and went on an expedition.
Then we found the glasses&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the man, “so you are the children who put up
that sign?”</p>

<p>“I wrote it,” Tommy explained with pride. “Did you
read it?”</p>

<p>“I tried to, but it didn’t make sense. Where did you find
the glasses?”</p>

<p>“’Way up in the woods. We were following a trail to the
ends of the earth. We found the glasses in a bramble bush
so we called them eyes and said they belonged to a wondrous
wise man. That was because we found them in a bramble bush.
You know the rhyme?”</p>

<p>“What rhyme?”</p>

<p>“Why, the one about the man from our town,” Tommy answered.
“Say it for him, Muffs, won’t you?”</p>

<p>So Muffs made a curtsey and recited the nursery rhyme.
She was surprised that the headless man had never heard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“Everyone knows it,” she said. “It’s just one of those
rhymes that you hear everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the headless man thoughtfully, “I don’t
go to the right places to hear such rhymes.”</p>

<p>“He is nice,” thought Muffs. “He’s just as nice as he
can be when he isn’t angry.” Aloud she said, “You can come
here and I’ll say them for you. I think I like you.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not a very wise man, am I?” he asked.</p>

<p>Muffs shook her head. “I’m ’fraid not. There aren’t
many wise people, you know. I don’t believe I ever saw one.”</p>

<p>“Most little girls think their fathers are wondrous wise,”
said the headless man.</p>

<p>“Hers wasn’t,” Tommy put in. “He ran off to the ends
of the earth just because she broke some of his things. That
wasn’t wise.”</p>

<p>“But the things might have meant a great deal to him,”
the man said with a queer look at Muffs. “What is your name,
little girl?”</p>

<p>“Miss Muffet.”</p>

<p>“But I mean your real name, the name your mother gave
you.”</p>

<p>“My father gave me my name,” said Muffs. “Madeline,
after my mother. I guess he used to love her.”</p>

<p>But the headless man had turned and seemed not to be
listening. Without speaking to the children again he started
toward the workshop.</p>

<p>“He’s going to tell on us,” cried Muffs. “I didn’t think
he would!”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
“Oh, dear!” sighed Mary. “I hope he doesn’t tell too
much. I broke off a flower in his yard and even Daddy would
scold me for that.”</p>

<p>“We ought to write an apology,” said Tommy who was
fond of writing things.</p>

<p>“I’ll write it this time,” Mary said. “I’m older and can
spell better than you can. He said he couldn’t make sense out
of the Public Notice.”</p>

<p>So they let Mary do the writing but Muffs and Tommy told
her what to say.</p>

<p>“It looks all right,” said Muffs after she had read it and
passed it on to Tommy. “Shall we mail it to him?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know his name and we haven’t any stamps. I’ll
tell you what,” Mary said. “We’ll walk right into the workshop
and give it to him. Then if he and Daddy are talking
about us we can hear what they say.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" width="500" height="299" alt="We’ll walk right into the workshop
and give it to him." />
<div class="caption">MARY</div>
</div>

<p>Muffs and Tommy didn’t think they ought to sneak into
the shop like that. But Mary coaxed and at last they gave in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Holding each other’s shoulders and stepping very carefully on
the edge of the outside plank, they played they were a three-headed
monster creeping stealthily to his lair.</p>

<p>Great Aunt Charlotte opened the kitchen door just in time
to see them, although to her they looked like ordinary children.</p>

<p>“Mary!” she called. “Can you hold a tray straight without
spilling your father’s tea?”</p>

<p>Mary, who was the monster’s head, turned around so
quickly that the middle section of the monster fell off the Way
of Peril and landed in a forest of needles. Anyway, Muffs said
it felt like needles and the monster’s tail curled ’round her and
lifted her back on the walk again.</p>

<p>Tea and cakes served in the workshop! It was something
that had never happened as far back as the children could remember.
Mary was now a prim maid-in-waiting carrying the
King’s tray. She lifted the latch of the workshop door and
Tommy dropped the apology in among the tea things.</p>

<p>“Bless my buttons!” exclaimed Mr. Tyler, looking up in
surprise. “How long have you children been there?”</p>

<p>“We’ve only been children for the last minute,” Tommy
said solemnly. “Before that we were a three-headed monster
only our middle fell out and now Mary’s a maid-in-waiting.”</p>

<p>“So I see. Great Aunt Charlotte must have suspected that
I had an important guest this afternoon,” Mr. Tyler said as
Mary handed him the tray. He passed the cakes, took one himself
and then held up the paper. “What’s this? The bill?”
Then he saw it was addressed to <em>the headless man</em>. “We all
have heads here,” he chuckled. “Must be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“I am the headless man,” the guest announced and reached
for the slip of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
While he read it the children stood watching. They said
things to each other in whispers and nudges. He hadn’t told!
He hadn’t come to tell on them at all. Why, he was actually
smiling over their apology.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">

<div class="caption">
Dear Headless Man,<br />
<br />
We dident mean to teese you but<br />
you looked so funny without eny<br />
head. We thot you new how to<br />
play. This is sposed to<br />
be an apology<br />
<br />
Yours respecktfully<br />
The Magic Makers<br />
</div>
</div>

<p>“This is quite a document,” he said when he had finished
reading it. “Magic Makers, are you? Hmmm! What do you
know about magic?”</p>

<p>“We know a whole lot,” Muffs answered quickly. “Tommy
made up a secret charm and whatever we play comes true.”</p>

<p>“Well, now that is a lot. His father was telling me....”
Then a mysterious look passed between them that left the children
wondering just what Mr. Tyler was telling. Whatever it
was, the headless man seemed pleased. He tucked the apology
in his vest pocket as though it were a treasure and then put some
sugar in his tea and passed the cakes around to the children.</p>

<p>“This is a new rôle for me,” he said.</p>

<p>“This is cakes,” said Tommy between mouthfuls.</p>

<p>The headless man laughed. “Oh, I see. This is cakes,
not rolls at all. ’Twould take a magician to turn cakes into rolls,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“I can turn ’em into sponges,” Tommy announced. He
reached in his pocket for the Bramble Bush Man’s glasses while
the headless man and Mr. Tyler both looked on in amazement.
Muffs and Mary looked too and saw the tiny cakes turn into
sponges with holes large enough to put a finger in.</p>

<p>“Wonderful glasses!” exclaimed Mr. Tyler.</p>

<p>“They ought to be when they belong to such a wonderful
man,” Muffs said as she handed them back to Tommy. “He
even made his house disappear.”</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said the headless man. “I never saw a
house disappear.”</p>

<p>“Well, we did,” the children assured him. And nothing
would do but they tell him all about it. With three of them
to tell it, what one forgot the others supplied and nothing was
left out. They expected him to say “Nonsense” to this and
“Fiddlesticks” to that. But he didn’t. He listened to every
word just as if he believed in magic too.</p>

<p>There were tears in Muffs’ eyes when she told him about
the vase and how she had broken it. Such a pretty vase and
she had barely touched it.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s just the way I am,” she sighed. “I’m always
and always breaking things. Even when I was a little
baby&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The headless man interrupted her with a cough and, all at
once, Muffs wondered if they weren’t telling too much.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you very well,” she said. “Mother says I
mustn’t talk to people unless I know their names.”</p>

<p>“The Headless Man fits me very well,” the stranger said
sorrowfully, “but perhaps even a headless man could do something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
“You could if you knew the Bramble Bush Man. He lives
in a house with looking-glass walls&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He does indeed!”</p>

<p>“You’ll help us find him!” the children cried. “You really
know him?”</p>

<p>“I believe I do.”</p>

<p>“And is he a wondrous wise man?” Muffs asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>The headless man nodded. “He’s growing wiser every
day.”</p>

<p>Muffs wrote all about the headless man in a letter to her
mother. It was the longest letter she had ever written all by
herself and she felt very happy when she slid the fat envelope
through the letter drop in the Post Office. She felt happier still
a few days later when the answer came back addressed to Muffs
herself in care of Mrs. Tyler. It was a long letter and Tommy
helped her read it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi">Dear little Madeline Muffins Moffet: Whoever thought you could
write such a letter? I think your headless man sounds nice. He
must have looked funny but I’m glad you apologized for chasing
him. It isn’t fun to make people cross, especially men. If I were
you I would forget the Bramble Bush Man because he isn’t real
and be nice to the real headless man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Are you sure the letter says the Bramble Bush Man isn’t
real?” Muffs asked, looking worried.</p>

<p>“That’s what it says,” Tommy replied. “I guess you didn’t
tell your mother that the headless man knows him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he really does, Tommy?”</p>

<p>The boy nodded and Muffs, with a happy sigh, went on
reading her letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi mb0">Now I have something important to tell you. Summer school will
be over in just one more week and I am coming to take you home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
I don’t know whether you will be glad or sorry but, till then&mdash;</p>

<p class="mt0 mb0">Goodbye, and all my love, Mother.</p>

<p>“Which will you be,” Tommy asked, “glad or sorry?”</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt="She and Tommy were sitting on the Way of Peril and
everything around them had grown dear to Muffs." />
</div>

<p>“A little bit of both. Glad to see Mother and sorry not to
have you and Mary to play with any more. I’ll miss Donald
and baby Ellen too and your mother and father and Great Aunt
Charlotte&mdash;and the headless man. He’s getting sort of&mdash;sort of
mysterious, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“And he promised to help find the Bramble Bush Man.
Gee! You’ll miss him too,” Tommy said. “Couldn’t you coax
your mother to let you stay?”</p>

<p>Muffs shook her head. “My school begins in a week. But
I do like it here,” she added wistfully.</p>

<p>She and Tommy were sitting on the Way of Peril and
everything around them had grown dear to Muffs. She looked
out across the swamp to the trees and little stream beyond and
thought how different the city was&mdash;just hard pavement and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
children who had never learned how to play. She tried to think
of all the nice things she used to do in New York but none of
them were very exciting. They weren’t a bit like the expedition
or the burned tailor shop or painting the house for Bunny Bright
Eyes. There was no Way of Peril to walk, no make-believe
creatures and no children half as nice as Mary and Tommy.
Donald and Mr. Tyler were always doing wonderfully interesting
things too and Mrs. Tyler was a dear. So was Great Aunt
Charlotte bedtimes when she passed out pink peppermint candy
pillows. Muffs’ little dream fairies slept on them. And it was
nice to have a baby in the house to pet and play with. Even
the cats were comforting when they sat in anyone’s lap and
purred. Thomas Junior wasn’t much given to sitting in laps
but Tabby often sat with Muffs. Her fur was soft and white
and made the little girl think of Bunny Bright Eyes, the only
pet she had ever had.</p>

<p>“If only Mother would stay here,” she thought, “and I
had Bunny Bright Eyes again, everything would be just perfect
and I wouldn’t care if we never went back to the studio in New
York.”</p>

<p>Then she saw Mary coming up the road, wheeling Ellen
in her carriage. She had just put her to sleep and now she was
ready to play.</p>

<p>“Muffs’ mother is going to take her back to New York,”
Tommy announced as soon as Mary came into the wood yard.</p>

<p>To their surprise, Mary burst into tears and ran up the One
Way Steps and into the workshop.</p>

<p>“She’s gone to tell Daddy,” Tommy decided. “She tells
Daddy and Donald everything.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know she liked me that much,” Muffs said.</p>

<div class="figcenter width197">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
<img src="images/p21.jpg" width="197" height="300" alt="Ever since that day she went to the workshop crying
she had acted as if she knew a secret." />
</div>

<p>As the time for her to go home came nearer Muffs grew
more and more puzzled. There were days when they hardly
saw Mary. Ever since that day she went to the workshop crying
she had acted as if she knew a secret. Donald was in on it too
and so was Mr. Tyler. The three of them had taken the short-cut
and gone somewhere without saying a word to Muffs and
Tommy.</p>

<p>“We could watch and see where they went,” Muffs suggested.</p>

<p>So she and Tommy, hand in hand, started along the short-cut.
It went through the swamp on stepping stones and then
through the field and over what Tommy called the fairies’ hills
because they were only little mounds with wintergreens growing
on them.</p>

<p>“Want to taste a fairy apple?” he asked and Muffs, who
had never tasted a wintergreen berry before, thought the fairies
had nicer apples than those that grew on full-sized apple trees.</p>

<p>They crawled under the pasture fence and then, as they
came in sight of the grange hall, things began to appear strange.
A big truck was standing in the driveway and men were carrying
things out of it and into the grange hall.</p>

<p>“It’s a moving van,” Muffs exclaimed. “Somebody must
be moving in.”</p>

<p>“People don’t move into public halls,” Tommy objected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
“Maybe they just bought some new furniture for the grange.
But gee! What funny furniture!”</p>

<p>“A new piano,” guessed Muffs as the moving men shouldered
a box-like object and carried it through the door.</p>

<p>“They have a piano,” said Tommy. “I know because they
play it at socials for the grown-ups to dance.”</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t a piano. Look-ee! I know what those are.
Japanese lanterns in all different colors. It must be a ball like
Cinderella went to. I wish we had a fairy godmother.”</p>

<p>The next thing to be unloaded was a pile of folding chairs.
Then another pile of folding chairs&mdash;and another and another.</p>

<p>“My! What a lot of chairs,” exclaimed Muffs. “They’ll
be fun for playing ‘Going to Jerusalem.’”</p>

<p>“We won’t be allowed to play,” Tommy said. “It’s prob’ly
some grown-up doings and they’re just going to sit. Muffs, do
you suppose Daddy and Donald and Mary are over there?”</p>

<p>“I thought I saw Mary, and look! There’s the headless
man! He’s showing the moving men where to put the chairs!”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Tommy. “He’s not so good at keeping
promises. I should think he’d come and see us if he’s really
trying to find the Bramble Bush Man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is any Bramble Bush Man,” said
Muffs suddenly. “We just made it up.”</p>

<p>Tommy whirled on her. “You’re not a Magic Maker if
you quit believing. You’ll never have any fun. You’ll just
grow up full of scowl wrinkles like Mr. and Mrs. Lippett and
people will call you a dragon. You wouldn’t want that to happen,
would you?”</p>

<p>“No-oo,” Muffs agreed doubtfully. “But you can’t keep
on believing forever when nothing happens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
“We’ll make something happen then,” declared Tommy.
“Pretty soon the moving van will be empty and we can climb
in and hide. Then when they start to drive away we can pop
up and surprise the headless man. He’ll remember his promise
all right then. He may even tell the men to drive us around
to the Bramble Bush Man’s house.”</p>

<p>This plan was a little too daring to suit Muffs. Things
happened sometimes and whenever things did happen she usually
got the blame.</p>

<p>“They might not stop,” she said. “The headless man
won’t tell his name and those moving men may be kidnappers
for all we know.”</p>

<p>“’Fraid Cat!”</p>

<p>“Well, I want Mother to <em>find</em> me when she comes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks!” said Tommy. “You’ll be going and we
can’t have just one last adventure. If you don’t see the Bramble
Bush Man pretty soon you’ll never see him.”</p>

<p>Still Muffs felt afraid.</p>

<p>“All right! Don’t!” Tommy said angrily. “I’ll climb into
the moving van and go to see the Bramble Bush Man myself.”</p>

<p>“Without me!” cried Muffs. “Oh, Tommy, not without
me!”</p>

<p>He grinned. It was easy to make Muffs do what he wanted
her to. Soon they were crossing the road and stealing up to
the empty moving van. The men were still busy in the grange
hall and it was easy to climb in without being seen. There were
a few old quilts and a mattress on the floor of the truck. The
mattress was clean and comfortable and the children sat down
on it to wait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
“They’re taking a long time,” said Tommy after about ten
minutes of waiting.</p>

<p>“Maybe they can’t find places for all those chairs,” Muffs
replied. “I hope they don’t put them back in here so we can’t
lie on this nice bed. I’m getting sleepy.”</p>

<p>Tommy yawned and sprawled on the mattress too. He and
Muffs had played hard that morning and both of them were
tired.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep my ears open,” thought Tommy as he closed
his eyes. But ears have a habit of drifting off to dreamland too
and so when the men returned, talking and laughing, neither
Muffs nor Tommy heard a sound. And when the driver started
neither he nor his helper nor the headless man guessed that
there were two children in the back of the van lying on a mattress
sound asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PARTY_IN_THE_AIR" id="A_PARTY_IN_THE_AIR"></a>A PARTY IN THE AIR</h2>


<p>The sun’s rays streaming through wide windows the next
morning woke Muffs from her long sleep. She sat up in a bed
that she had never seen before and looked about. Someone had
taken off her shoes but she was still wearing her dress and it was
dreadfully wrinkled. She felt quite untidy in such a clean little
bed. The bed was just her size too and had a gay spread with
butterflies on it. There were butterfly curtains at the windows
too and beyond she could see a door opening into another room,
like a palace, with a ceiling all of glass. Along the window sills
in both rooms were flowers and growing plants. A long glass
tank had plants in it too and tiny fish that swam about and
made silver streaks through the water.</p>

<p>“I must be in fairyland,” thought Muffs, not quite sure
that she was fully awake.</p>

<p>She climbed out of bed and there were her shoes, side by
side, on the floor under the bed. She didn’t put them on at once
because the soft rug felt good to her bare feet. It was such a
lovely room all green and gold like the studio at home only
much, much richer. It was a little bare though. Muffs was
used to seeing a great many things crowded into two small rooms
and so most places in the country seemed bare. She began exploring
first the room and then the hall. She tried to open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
door of the room across the hall but it was locked. Then she
looked out of the hall window and saw a lawn with hedges and
farther down the road was the school where Tommy went.</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p23.jpg" width="500" height="434" alt="A tousled head
appeared at the foot of the stairs." />
</div>

<p>“Why-ee!” she gasped. “This must be the headless man’s
house. He found me in the moving van and put me to bed. I
wonder where Tommy is. Tom-meee!” she called, beginning
to feel rather frightened.</p>

<p>“Here I am,” cried an impish voice and a tousled head
appeared at the foot of the stairs. “Gee! I thought you’d never
wake up. Look whose house we’re in. The Bramble Bush
Man’s!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
And to prove it he held up the Guide, his gash of a mouth
smiling as happily as before. Tommy had placed the glasses
on his nose and he looked the same as ever except for his
withered leaves and one broken arm.</p>

<p>“But this is the headless man’s house,” Muffs answered,
more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>“Sure! The Bramble Bush Man lives with him. <em>This is
the Bramble Bush Man.</em>”</p>

<p>Muffs looked long and hard at the stick creature and then
opened her mouth as wide as she could and let out one scream
after another.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it to be the Bramble Bush Man! I don’t
want it to be the Bramble Bush Man!” she screamed. “I want
the Bramble Bush Man to be real and tell me where my daddy
went.”</p>

<p>Tommy stood helpless, holding his beloved stick. It
suited him all right. It was real enough for him.</p>

<p>Then the headless man appeared and Muffs stopped a
scream right in the middle of it. The headless man would be
as angry as he was that day the children chased him.</p>

<p>But stranger things were happening by the minute. The
headless man wasn’t angry at all.</p>

<p>“There! There!” he said. “Stop this screaming and
we’ll find the Bramble Bush Man at once.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t&mdash;he isn’t a stick?” gasped Muffs, still sobbing
a little.</p>

<p>“Tommy’s Bramble Bush Man may be a stick, but yours
isn’t. He’ll find your daddy for you if he has to go to the ends
of the earth. Now dry your tears and have breakfast with the
lonesome old headless man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
“Are you really so lonesome?” asked Muffs when they
were seated around the breakfast table. They had gone down
two long flights of stairs and into a spacious dining room.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the headless man. “Very lonesome indeed.
A big house like this ought to have children in it.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny,” Muffs replied. “But Mother and I live in
two tiny rooms and the landlady doesn’t like children.”</p>

<p>“I thought I didn’t&mdash;once.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width448">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" width="448" height="240" alt="After that came Tommy’s favorite
dish&mdash;pancakes." />
</div>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve changed your mind,” Muffs said, smiling
at him over her grapefruit. He had put a cherry in the center
just the way she liked it and after that came Tommy’s favorite
dish&mdash;pancakes. Muffs ate five and Tommy had seven and an
extra helping of jam. That was for the Guide who sat in the
chair beside him.</p>

<p>“Wise people like jam,” he said in explanation.</p>

<p>While they ate the headless man told how he had discovered
them asleep when he went back to the van to find something
the moving men had forgotten to deliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
“Otherwise,” he said, “you might be on your way to
Chicago with a load of furniture that left at four o’clock this
morning. It was taking an awful chance to climb into an empty
moving van. Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“We wanted to surprise you,” Tommy explained. “We
thought you had forgotten about the Bramble Bush Man.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I haven’t and if it’s in my power you shall see him
this very day.”</p>

<p>Of course the children wanted to know when and where
but the headless man would say no more and hurried them away
from the table.</p>

<p>“Come! Come!” he urged. “You mustn’t stay here any
longer or you’ll miss the party.”</p>

<p>“Party!” exclaimed Tommy. “It must be a surprise party.
We never heard about it.”</p>

<p>“It will be a surprise party,” he said.</p>

<p>Muffs looked puzzled. “Is it somebody’s birthday?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go along and see,” declared the headless man.</p>

<p>“Were you invited?”</p>

<p>He scratched his head as if he were thinking. “Now let
me see,” he said slowly. “I wasn’t exactly invited but if it’s a
surprise party, don’t you think I might go as a surprise?”</p>

<p>The children thought at first that he was joking but when
he said goodbye, his last words were, “I’ll see you both at the
party.”</p>

<p>When they reached Tommy’s house someone was waiting
on the porch. It was someone with golden hair and golden
brown eyes and cheeks as rosy as Muffs’ own. It might have
been Muffs herself except that this lovely person was a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
instead of a little girl. She held out both arms and Muffs rushed
into them.</p>

<p>“Mother!” she cried, half laughing and half crying. “I
didn’t think you’d come for another week.”</p>

<p>“I had to come when my little girl was lost. Mrs. Tyler
sent a telegram. Muffs, <em>dear!</em> Where were you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! The loveliest place, all light and flowers
and pretty colors. You would have painted it. It was so beautiful!”</p>

<p>“But how did you happen to go there? And why didn’t
you come home before?”</p>

<p>“She slept too long,” Tommy explained. “We went to
sleep in a moving van,” and he told Mrs. Moffet all that had
happened and how kind the headless man had been. He even
told about the Guide and how he had saved him. Tommy had
the Guide under his arm and that proved everything.</p>

<p>“We’d have been to Chicago by now,” he finished, “if he
hadn’t found us and taken us to his house. He just let us sleep
’til we woke up. Then we had pancakes! Mmmm! And can
the headless man cook!”</p>

<p>Muffs’ mother laughed but there was a worried look in her
face as well. It might have happened so differently. She
clasped her little girl very close and held her for a long time.</p>

<p>“I must dress,” Muffs said finally. “We’re going to a
party.”</p>

<p>“We can’t, darling. The train&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But we <em>must</em>,” Muffs interrupted. “It’s a surprise party
but the headless man told and he says it’s still going to be a
surprise. He’s expecting us to be there and I wouldn’t miss
it for anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
“If that’s the case,” said her mother, “we’ll take a later
train. Put on your blue dress&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s got ink on it.”</p>

<p>“I spilled it there,” Tommy owned up. “I must have
spilled it when we wrote the Public Notice,” and he told about
that too.</p>

<p>My! What a lot of things there were to tell. Muffs and
Tommy chattered all the time they were getting ready. Mrs.
Moffet put on a fresh dress too and stood waiting by the window.
She could see across the pasture to where crowds were already
beginning to gather around the grange hall.</p>

<p>“We’re ready now,” Mrs. Tyler said, coming into the room
with the baby toddling at her side.</p>

<p>“But where’s Mary?” Tommy asked.</p>

<p>“She went on ahead with your father and Donald and
Great Aunt Charlotte.”</p>

<p>“Is Great Aunt Charlotte going too? Gee! What a funny
kind of party.”</p>

<p>“It’s in the grange hall.”</p>

<p>“And we’re just going to sit? Aw, Mom! That won’t be
any fun.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it?” she said with a knowing smile. “Hadn’t you
better come along and see.”</p>

<p>They took the short-cut. Muffs always wanted to take
the short-cut now so she wouldn’t have to pass the dragons’
house but she soon discovered that Mr. and Mrs. Lippett and
everyone else in the valley were coming to the party. Not only
that, there were big, expensive-looking cars from the other side
of Lookoff Mountain and a whole bus load of school children.
The road was full of parked cars and the grove at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
short-cut was crowded with children. There was a great circle
of them playing “Drop the Handkerchief.” Muffs slipped into
the circle quietly but as soon as they saw her the whole crowd
of children called out, “Surprise!”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t my birthday,” Muffs objected.</p>

<p>“It’s a farewell party because you’re going, Muffs,” Mary
whispered.</p>

<p>“Speech! Speech!” they all shouted.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t speak. I wouldn’t know what to say.”</p>

<p>“You can sing, honey,” her mother said softly.</p>

<p>So Muffs stood on tiptoe and her voice trilled an old love
song her mother had taught her. When she had finished she
saw that the headless man had been standing under a nearby
tree listening to her. She waved to him but he had his handkerchief
out blowing his nose and didn’t notice. Then Muffs turned
to her mother, or to the place where she thought her mother
would be standing. There was no one there.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?” she asked Tommy.</p>

<p>He pointed to a chair. “She went over there and sat
down,” he said. “Her face got awful white. I guess she’s
sick.”</p>

<p>Muffs ran to her and put her arms around her neck.
“What’s the matter, Mother?” she asked. “Did it make you
dizzy to play the games?”</p>

<p>“No, dear,” Mrs. Moffet replied, rising to her feet in a
hurry. “But we must go, dear. We must go quickly! We
must take the next train.”</p>

<p>“And miss the party!”</p>

<p>“Would you mind very much if we missed the party?”</p>

<p>Muffs stared at her mother without answering. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
couldn’t think of anything to say. Her mother knew she’d mind
and she had said they could take a later train. Then Mrs. Tyler
saw that something was wrong and came hurrying along the
grass with baby Ellen snatching at timothy heads as they passed
and calling, “Pitty pussy. <em>Want</em> pitty pussy.”</p>

<p>Muffs spoke in a voice that was full of bewilderment.
“Mother says I must go home. She says I must go home and
miss the party.”</p>

<p>“Really, Mrs. Moffet,” Mrs. Tyler said, “hadn’t you
better think it over a little longer? You’re welcome to stay with
us and besides&mdash;it isn’t fair to Muffs.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>“No,” she said finally, lifting her head and looking into
her little girl’s anxious face. “I guess it isn’t. Run along, dear,
and have a good time. Don’t mind me. I’ve just got a headache.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask the Bramble Bush Man what’s good for headaches,”
said Muffins brightly. “I forgot to tell you, Mother,
but the headless man knows him and he really is wondrous wise
and we’re going to meet him today. Look! Everybody is going
into the grange hall. Mr. Tyler is calling them.”</p>

<p>And so he was! He had a horn to his lips and his voice
came out with a hollow sound:</p>

<p>“THIS WAY TO THE BIG SHOW. MEET THE BRAMBLE
BUSH MAN, THE WORLD’S GREATEST MAGICIAN.
WATCH HIS WONDERFUL TRICKS! COME ON, FOLKS!
DON’T MISS IT. IT’S THE SHOW OF A LIFE TIME!”</p>

<p>“He’s giving a show!” cried Muffs and her eyes were like
stars. “Mother! Do you hear it? The Bramble Bush Man is
giving a show?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
“Whoops!” shouted Tommy. “Talk about a surprise
party&mdash;and I thought we were just going to sit.”</p>

<p>“We are,” exclaimed Mary, joining them and taking
Muffs’ hand. “We’re going to sit and watch the wisest man in
the world and if you don’t believe it, just ask him what a tuffet
is. I asked him to make sure and he said it was a round
cushion.”</p>

<p>“You talked to him, Mary?”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Yes, and so did you. But just wait ’til
you see him on the stage. That’s the surprise!”</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCING_THE_MAGICIAN" id="INTRODUCING_THE_MAGICIAN"></a>INTRODUCING THE MAGICIAN</h2>


<p>In the grange hall rows and rows of chairs were lined up,
like soldiers, before the stage. Green and yellow streamers
hung from the ceiling and flowers were everywhere. Mary said
she helped decorate.</p>

<p>“What did you do with all the colored lanterns?” Tommy
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you see them? They’re going to be hung out in
the grove after the show. There’s cake and ice cream and
we’re going to bring the chairs out and sit and talk with the
Bramble Bush Man.”</p>

<p>Muffs felt too excited even to guess what he looked like.
“The Bramble Bush Man! The Bramble Bush Man!” her
thoughts kept saying. “He’s real! He’s true! I’m going to
see him!”</p>

<p>“You’re going to be so surprised,” Mary went on. “I
was. I couldn’t believe it at first and then I began to get used
to it and he isn’t at all the way we thought he was and he’s
studied so hard and tried out every one of his tricks before that
big mirror so that he’s <em>sure</em> how it will look to us down here in
the theatre. Honest, now, doesn’t the grange hall look something
like a theatre?”</p>

<p>Tommy said it did although he hadn’t the ghost of an idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
what Mary was talking about. She seemed to have found out a
lot all that time she wouldn’t play.</p>

<p>“It seems as though Muffs would have guessed it. She
must have remembered a little of what he looked like,” and
Mary kept talking things like that until they had walked the
whole length of the hall and were standing beside the first row
of chairs. A printed sign said RESERVED but Mary turned it
over and sat down, pushing Muffs and Tommy into the two
empty seats beside her.</p>

<p>“Mom’s out there in back with Ellen so she can go home
early if she cries. Daddy and Donald and Great Aunt Charlotte
are helping and we’re supposed to help too,” Mary whispered.</p>

<p>“But how can we help?”</p>

<p>“By sitting right up near the front so that I can go up
quickly when he calls on me.”</p>

<p>“When who calls on you?” asked Tommy, much mystified.</p>

<p>“Why, the Bramble Bush Man, of course. I’m to take part
in his show.”</p>

<p>Tommy gave a whistle of surprise but Muffs did not even
hear what Mary was saying. She was busy looking at the stage.
There everything was, just the way she had seen it in the Bramble
Bush Man’s queer little house that day they came in through
the window. There was the long table with many strange things
piled upon it. There was the plate and the ball and hoops and
rings and giant playing cards in a pile. Even the vase was there
and it looked as if it had never been broken. But the flags and
ribbons were not to be seen. Neither was the cage with the
rabbit in it.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Bunny Bright Eyes is,” Muffs said aloud.
“I wouldn’t like it if he wasn’t in the show.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
“Mary’s in it,” said Tommy reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Is she? Then why isn’t she on the stage?”</p>

<p>“I’m supposed to go up when he calls me. It’s near the
end of the show. I disappear.”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>“I disappear,” Mary repeated calmly. “The Bramble
Bush Man makes me disappear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that,” declared Tommy. “Even a wondrous
wise man couldn’t make a girl disappear.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<img src="images/p25.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="Will you
tell us how the house disappeared?" />
</div>

<p>“He could too. He made his house disappear, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Will you come back?” Muffs questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll come back and when it’s over I’ll tell you
how I did it.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us how the house disappeared?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
“I can’t,” said Mary, “because I don’t know.”</p>

<p>More and more people came in. All the chairs were filled
and the doorway, too, was filled with people who had come to
see the Bramble Bush Man’s big show. Tommy had the magic
glasses to his eyes and was looking over the crowd.</p>

<p>“I wonder where Mother is,” Muffs said.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s back there with Mom minding Ellen,”
Tommy suggested. “Maybe she’s afraid to come too close to a
wondrous wise man.”</p>

<p>“I guess she’d be afraid to disappear like I’m going to do,”
said Mary importantly.</p>

<p>Muffs was thinking very hard. The Bramble Bush Man
must be a rather terrible person if he could make things disappear
whenever he felt like it. Even his house! She looked
again at the stage, at the long table and the big bowls and rings
and playing cards upon it. She looked at the vase that was
whole again and shivered.</p>

<p>“I b’lieve he’s a giant after all,” she said.</p>

<p>Mary laughed and laughed. “Ha! Ha! Why, he isn’t
even a big man. Look! There he is now!”</p>

<p>She pointed but Muffs and Tommy could see no one who
looked in the least like a wondrous wise man. Mr. Tyler had
walked up toward the stage and he and the headless man stood
there talking. Then he pressed a button that made lights all
around the stage. A blue light shone from the ceiling, making
everything shadowy and mysterious the way it had been in the
Bramble Bush Man’s own house.</p>

<p>“But where is he?” Muffs and Tommy both asked. “We
don’t see him.”</p>

<p>“There he is! There! Right where I’m pointing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. Tyler had gone back to his seat and left the headless
man standing alone. Soon he went up the little stairs that
ended on the stage. Now he was standing before them and
smiling.</p>

<p>“He’s got a lot of nerve,” Tommy said.</p>

<p>Then everything was quiet for the headless man had begun
to speak. “Boys and girls, big and little,” he said. “I have
come to introduce the Bramble Bush Man, a wondrous wise
magician. He owes his name to three children who are sitting
here in the front row. Also, I think, his wisdom.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” whispered Tommy.</p>

<p>“He means us,” Mary whispered back. “Sh! He’s still
talking.”</p>

<p>“Watch carefully now. Hokus! Mokus! Pokus! and
PRESTO! You have the Bramble Bush Man.”</p>

<p>There was a flash of light and a booming sound. The headless
man had disappeared and there, in his place, stood the
Bramble Bush Man himself. He wore a golden robe with black
stars on it and a tall black silk hat. He had a black moustache
and black glasses but he was about the size of the headless man.</p>

<p>“I bet he’s the headless man with a black and gold robe
and a make-believe moustache,” Tommy whispered.</p>

<p>He looked around, expecting Mary to say, “he is not,” but
she and Muffs were both busy watching the magician. He had
pulled a hair from his moustache. It couldn’t have been more
than an inch long when he pulled it out but now he was stretching,
stretching it until it became the length of his arm.</p>

<p>“There,” he said. “That is how we stretch a hair. Now
that it is long enough, I shall proceed to thread it through my
hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
This he did, to the amazement and mystification of all who
were watching.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued, “I shall sew it through my head.”</p>

<p>He put the needle, hair and all, into his mouth.</p>

<p>“He’s swallowed it,” cried Tommy.</p>

<p>This time Mary did contradict him. “No, he hasn’t! He’s
sewing it through his head. Watch now! He’s taking his hat
off!”</p>

<p>First he felt for the hair and everyone expected him to
pull it out of his head but he searched awhile and couldn’t
find it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s in my hat,” he said at last and reached in
one hand to see. He drew the hand out and with it, a white
rabbit. “One hare is as good as another,” he chuckled and then
made a low bow.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Mary in a hushed voice. “They do
call a rabbit a hare.” But Muffs said, not in a hushed voice at
all but in a very loud one, “It’s Bunny Bright Eyes!”</p>

<p>The bunny twitched his nose just the way he used to do
and seemed to say, “Yes, little mistress, it’s Bunny Bright Eyes
and how glad I am to see you again!”</p>

<p>“Will this little girl step up to the stage just a moment?”
the magician was asking.</p>

<p>“Who? Me?” cried Muffs. She looked at Mary. Surely
he must mean Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. Madeline Moffet. You’re the girl I want to
hold this rabbit while I make him a cage.”</p>

<p>Muffs walked uncertainly up the steps and onto the stage.
She felt afraid at first but all that feeling left her when she had
Bunny Bright Eyes in her arms again.</p>

<div class="figcenter width478">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
<img src="images/p26.jpg" width="478" height="662" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">One Hare Is as Good as Another,” the Magician Said.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“Place this hat on the table,” said the magician. “Bunny
Bright Eyes has a little present for you.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Muffs moving closer to the Bramble
Bush Man and wondering if maybe he wasn’t the headless man’s
twin brother. He wanted her handkerchief and she gladly gave
it to him.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind what happens to it,” he said as he
began rolling it into a ball. Soon the handkerchief was gone
and in its place was a round white egg!</p>

<p>“My handkerchief!” cried Muffs.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s in your pocket,” said the Bramble Bush
Man.</p>

<p>“But what became of the egg?” Muffs asked.</p>

<p>He suggested that she look in the hat where Bunny Bright
Eyes was. Sure enough. There was the egg!</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed the magician. “Now will you believe
in the Easter Rabbit? It’s a magic egg too. I’ll break it
and show you.”</p>

<p>He gave it three taps on the edge of the long table. It
broke and a cage unfolded before the audience. It was the same
cage that had disappeared back in the Bramble Bush Man’s
house.</p>

<p>“As a rule,” he said, “magicians don’t explain their tricks
but a certain little girl,” and he looked at Muffs, “would just
love to know something about this cage. Look, everybody!”</p>

<p>He touched the cage with the magic wand and it disappeared
in his hand. Then he held up a tiny piece of metal and
unfolded the cage again.</p>

<p>“Easy! A folding cage inside a hollow wooden egg.
You’ve seen a magnet attract a pin or a needle. Well, the magnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
on the end of my magic wand attracts the spring that collapses
the cage.”</p>

<p>He set the cage down on the table. “There’s a house for
you, Bunny Bright Eyes,” he said and the rabbit hopped into it.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tommy stood up in his chair. “Oh, Mr. Bramble
Bush Man,” he called. “We have a better house than that.
Just wait!”</p>

<p>So everybody waited and the Bramble Bush Man entertained
them with more tricks until Tommy came back with the
red and green house that the children had painted. He walked
boldly up on the stage and placed it on the long table. “There!”
said he, “It’s a prize for Bunny Bright Eyes.”</p>

<p>The audience thought this was part of the show. They
watched the house, expecting it to disappear but this house was
solid. The rabbit could live in it without any danger of having
it vanish over his head some cold night in winter. Tommy explained
this in a loud voice and the Bramble Bush Man thanked
him.</p>

<p>“Boy! What a show!” said a voice below the stage.</p>

<p>Muffs and Tommy both took their seats soon after that for
the great act of vanishing a girl was about to begin. Muffs almost
held her breath and Tommy looked a little whiter than
usual. It might be fun to watch some stranger disappear. But
Mary! They remembered how they had never been able to find
the Bramble Bush Man’s house again.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’ll come back, Mary?” they both asked,
holding her hands until the last minute.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she promised them. “I told you I’d come back
only you couldn’t guess in a million years how I’m going to
do it.”</p>

<h2><a name="STAGE_MAGIC" id="STAGE_MAGIC"></a>STAGE MAGIC</h2>


<p>Muffs was glad when her mother slipped into the empty
seat that Mary had left. She looked beautiful with her face
turned up toward the stage. She wasn’t paying any attention
to Muffs, only to the Bramble Bush Man standing there in the
blue shadows. Mary stood beside him. Muffs had always
thought of Mary as a big girl but now she looked very, very
small. Could people shrink, Muffs wondered. Could they
grow so small they couldn’t be seen and then grow big again?
Alice in Wonderland did but, of course, that was only a story.
Muffs couldn’t think of any other way that a girl could disappear.
She wiggled and turned in her seat. It was impossible for her
to sit still when she was so excited.</p>

<p>Oh! Mary was climbing up onto the long table! The
Bramble Bush Man was telling her to lie down!</p>

<p>“It doesn’t hurt to disappear, does it, Mary?” he was
asking.</p>

<p>Mary laughed and said, “Of course not,” in a very happy
voice. Nobody seemed worried. Even Muffs’ mother who had
been afraid sat there watching just as if she felt sure everything
would be all right.</p>

<p>“He isn’t going to put up a screen the way most magicians
do,” she said almost to herself. “He would be different. The
dear man!”</p>

<div class="figcenter width272">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
<img src="images/p27.jpg" width="272" height="362" alt=" There
was that same flash of light and then&mdash;Boom!" />
</div>

<p>“What did you say, Mother?” Muffs asked.</p>

<p>“I said he was different,” her mother replied quickly.
“Watch, darling! He’s doing this for us.”</p>

<p>Muffs wondered why her mother said that. But there
wasn’t much time to wonder. The Bramble Bush Man was
chanting something and waving his wand over Mary. There
was that same flash of light and then&mdash;Boom!</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” cried Muffs but nobody heard her because
at the same time exclamations of surprise went up from everyone
else in the audience. The table top was empty. The magician
had done what he said he would do. He had made a girl vanish
right there on the stage.</p>

<p>“That’s magic,” he said, beaming. “But it wouldn’t be
real magic if I couldn’t bring the girl back again. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
ever heard of Mistress Mary Quite Contrary? Would you like
to see how her garden grows?”</p>

<p>The clapping below the stage showed that everybody did
want to see it so the Bramble Bush Man, still holding his wand,
walked over to the edge of the platform where the large vase
that Muffs thought she had broken stood on its stand.</p>

<p>“We have to say a few magic words first,” he explained,
“and then wave the wand and presto! Up comes a rose bush.
Why, hello, Mary! There you are. I thought you disappeared
a while ago.”</p>

<p>Right out of the vase, if it wasn’t some strange dream, grew
first the rose bush and then Mary herself smiling through the
parted branches.</p>

<p>“They’re real roses too,” declared the magician, “not
wooden like the egg. Here they are! Catch this one! And
this one!”</p>

<p>He and Mary were throwing all the roses out to the children
who were watching. Muffs’ mother caught one but instead
of giving it to Muffs she kissed it and put it away in her purse.</p>

<p>Soon the vase was as empty as it had been before the
Bramble Bush Man waved his wand over it.</p>

<p>“Ah, there!” he said. “I’ve given away all my flowers.”</p>

<p>“Grow some more,” Mary told him. She was still standing
on the stage and looked very lovely indeed for she had kept
one of the roses and fastened it in her hair.</p>

<p>“Grow a lily,” somebody in the audience shouted.</p>

<p>Almost immediately a tall, slender lily sprang up out of
the pot.</p>

<p>“Who asked for the lily?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said a tall, gawky boy in the audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
He came up on the stage to get it and everybody laughed
as he took the lily, sniffed it and some of the yellow pollen came
off on the end of his nose.</p>

<p>Tommy nudged Muffs and whispered, “He’s wondrous wise
all right if he can grow anything you tell him. Grow a Bramble
Bush!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” called several other children. “Grow a
Bramble Bush.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” the magician answered. “If I can’t grow
a Bramble Bush and scratch my eyes out in it I’m not the real
Bramble Bush Man.”</p>

<p>“Gee! He can’t really scratch his eyes out!” Tommy exclaimed.</p>

<p>“He can so,” said Mary who had come down from the stage
and squeezed in the chair between Muffs and Tommy. “He can
do anything!”</p>

<p>“Can he, Mother?” Muffs asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” she replied. “I think he can.”</p>

<p>The children were growing more excited now. They were
standing up in their chairs and calling when, all at once, everything
became quiet. The magician was saying his magic words
and slowly, slowly, out of the flower pot a real bramble bush
spread its branches. It was bigger than the rose bush and taller
than the lily and it was covered with berries which the Bramble
Bush Man passed around for the children to taste. All the time
they kept watching him, wondering if he really meant to scratch
out his eyes.</p>

<p>They had not long to wonder. Soon the berries were gone
from the bush and the magician stood beside it again.</p>

<p>“<em>Hokus! Mokus! Pokus!</em>” he said in a mysterious voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Then he gave one leap and the bush seemed to leap toward him.
The vase was empty once more and the Bramble Bush Man was
caught in a tangle of briars. Laughter and squeals filled the
room while he struggled to free himself and then&mdash;it happened!
He hadn’t any eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, folks,” he said cheerfully. “All I need to
do is grow another bush and scratch them in again.”</p>

<p>The audience was clapping now. Clap! Clap! Clap!
went a hundred pair of hands. Perhaps some of them guessed
that the magician had only closed his eyes so tightly that they
appeared not to be there. Whether they did or not, they knew
it was the trick they had been waiting for. None of them expected
the surprise.</p>

<p>The Bramble Bush Man had turned around, jumped into
the other bush and scratched his eyes in again. He had scratched
his eyes in again <em>but</em>&mdash;he had scratched off his moustache. His
black robe with the gold stars was gone too and he not only
looked like but he was the headless man.</p>

<p>“Headless man! Headless man!” a few of the children
who had chased him began to call.</p>

<p>He put up his hand. “Not any more. From now on I
want to be known as The Bramble Bush Man. Have I earned
the title?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes!” shouted a great many voices and almost at
once as many questions were shouted up from the audience:</p>

<p>“How did you stretch the hair? How did you make the
bramble bush grow? Where did Mary go when she vanished?”</p>

<p>There were others too, but Tommy asked the most baffling
question of all:</p>

<p>“How did your house disappear?”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TRICK_HOUSE" id="THE_TRICK_HOUSE"></a>THE TRICK HOUSE</h2>


<p>The show was over. The Bramble Bush Man had left the
stage saying very briefly that magicians don’t explain their tricks
and thanking the people for watching him. Then Mrs. Tyler
called out something about refreshments being served in the
grove and, in almost no time, the hall was empty.</p>

<p>Out in the grove the Japanese lanterns were lighted and
Great Aunt Charlotte was passing out trays of food to several
girls in white who were serving. Muffs pulled her mother’s
hand.</p>

<p>“There’s the Bramble Bush Man and he’s standing all
alone. Let’s go over and talk with him.”</p>

<p>“Not now, dear,” Mrs. Moffet said in a strange voice.
Then she walked swiftly away leaving Muffs there with Mary
and Tommy.</p>

<p>“She didn’t stay for the ice cream!” they exclaimed all at
once.</p>

<p>“No matter how grown-up I get,” Mary said, “I’m sure I’ll
<em>always</em> stay for ice cream.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! We can go over and talk to the Bramble Bush
Man anyway,” declared Tommy. “He didn’t have a chance to
explain about the house disappearing.”</p>

<p>“He said magicians don’t explain their tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
“But that wasn’t part of the show. Say, Mary! Maybe
he made the house disappear the same way he did that trick with
you. You promised to tell us.”</p>

<p>“I’d show you,” she said, “only I don’t know how to get in
there under the stage now that the table is closed up again.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked the other two.</p>

<p>Mary stood stock still and spoke in a mysterious voice that
made her secret seem even greater than it was:</p>

<p>“There’s a hiding place inside the table. You remember
how thick the top was? Well, there’s a sliding panel of thin
wood and when I disappeared the panel really slid out from
under me and I dropped right into the table.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Muffs.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Tommy. “How did you get out?”</p>

<p>Mary laughed. “Oh, that was easy. I slid out through
the table leg. It was hollow and went down like a tunnel right
under the stage. Donald was down there to help make the
flowers grow and he wrapped me all up in the roses and pushed
us both right up through the stand and through the bottom of
the vase&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You and the roses?”</p>

<p>“Of course. The thorns were all taken off so they wouldn’t
scratch me. They did though, just a little,” and she showed
them the tiniest scratch on her arm above the elbow.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy after a moment of deep thought, “the
house couldn’t have disappeared the way you did, now could it?”</p>

<p>The disappearance of the house, they all decided, was
something the Bramble Bush Man alone might tell them. He
seemed to be waiting for them there under a tree. He even had
extra plates of cakes and as soon as he saw them coming he drew
up their chairs and called to one of the girls to bring more ice
cream.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
<img src="images/p28.jpg" width="400" height="519" alt="As soon as he
saw them coming he drew up their chairs and called to one of the girls
to bring more ice cream." />
</div>

<p>“I thought we might have tea together again,” he said.
“I wanted to hear how you liked the show.”</p>

<p>The children were all silent for a moment. There weren’t
any words big enough for them to tell him how well they liked
it. Finally, when Muffs was seated and he had passed the cakes,
she asked a question.</p>

<p>“My mother said you gave the show for us. Did you?”</p>

<p>“For you, angel girl, and your delightful friends. I did
not flatter myself to think that your mother would want to
watch it.”</p>

<p>“She did!” Muffs told him, “and she kissed the rose you
threw down to her and put it in her pocketbook.”</p>

<p>At first Muffs thought maybe she had said the wrong thing
because the magician looked at her so strangely. It was hard
to talk with him. There had been so many things she wanted to
ask&mdash;where the ends of the earth were, how to make her mother
happy and what had happened to his house when it disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Mary and Tommy were asking things. Tommy was even
forgetting to eat his ice cream he was so interested in the wondrous
wise man’s replies. At last he asked about the house but,
instead of answering him, the magician began to draw pictures
on a little note book that he took from his pocket.</p>

<p>First he drew a large house. The children knew it at
once. It was the Millionaire’s House where the headless man
lived and, since the headless man was the Bramble Bush Man,
it must be the house where he lived also.</p>

<p>Next he drew a tiny house with only one window.</p>

<p>“That’s the house that disappeared!” cried the three children
all at once.</p>

<p>“Only,” Tommy added, “you forgot the walk that went up
to the window.”</p>

<p>“The walk! The <em>walk!</em> My stars! That was no walk!”
exclaimed the magician. “That was only a plank that the moving
men placed there so that they could move in my big table
without carrying it up three flights of stairs.”</p>

<p>“How could there be three flights of stairs in such a tiny
house?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>Without a word, the magician began drawing another
picture. It was a picture of the side of the house and now the
children knew the secret.</p>

<p>“You see,” he explained, “it’s a trick house, although I
swear when I bought it I had no idea that it would ever fool
anybody. I just wanted a bigger lawn so I chose a house built
back into the side of a hill. It’s a steep hill. You must know
that if you climbed down it. So the house is only one story
high where the hill cuts into it and three stories high where
it faces the road.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width500">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
<img src="images/p29.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="So the house is
only one story high where the hill cuts into it and three stories high where
it faces the road." />
</div>

<p>“And we ran away without looking!” exclaimed Muffs,
“because we were so scared.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of me now, are you?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“No. That is, only a little because you’re wondrous wise
and I’m&mdash;I guess I’m afraid to ask you some of the questions
I wanted to. You see, you might think the earth hasn’t any
ends because it’s round but I know it does have ends because
my father went there.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the Bramble Bush Man, “it does have
ends. The ends are mighty lonesome too.”</p>

<p>“Have you been there?” asked Tommy who was just about
ready to believe anything.</p>

<p>“I live there,” replied the Bramble Bush Man.</p>

<p>“Then that path did lead to the ends of the earth just like
you said, Muffins, only your father wasn’t there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
“It’s just as well,” she returned with a grown-up air. “He
was a cranky man anyway and the Bramble Bush Man is nice.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you think so.” He held out his hand. “Let’s
shake on that. I think you’re nice too.”</p>

<p>But the children thought he was shaking goodbye to them.
They had almost forgotten to thank him for his magic. Then,
when they did remember, he surprised them by turning the
tables and thanking them for theirs.</p>



<div class="chapter">
<hr class="divider" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
</div>

<h2><a name="REAL_MAGIC" id="REAL_MAGIC"></a>REAL MAGIC</h2>


<p>“Our magic?” asked the children in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied the Bramble Bush Man, sitting down
in his chair again. They saw that he hadn’t meant them to
leave at all. “Certainly I should thank you for your magic.
It is a great deal more wonderful than mine. I could never
change glasses into eyes or a stick into a man. You are Magic
Makers of the first order while I am only a trick magician.”</p>

<p>“You are not. You’re wondrous wise,” said Mary forgetting
to be polite.</p>

<p>“I was not always so,” he admitted. “Not so long ago
I was a cranky headless man&mdash;headless in more ways than one.
It was your magic that worked the change.”</p>

<p>They began to see what he meant. But still they did not
quite understand.</p>

<p>“I’m no good at explaining things,” the magician confessed.
“My business is mystifying, not explaining. Run and
get your mother, Muffs girl. She can explain.”</p>

<p>“My mother!” Muffs exclaimed. “She’s afraid of you.
She said she didn’t want to meet you.”</p>

<p>“I want to meet her,” he insisted. “Tell her the Bramble
Bush Man wants to meet her, that he won’t take no for an
answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
“You’ll wait right here?” asked Muffs uncertainly. “And
may Mary and Tommy go with me? Mary’s good at getting
her own way.”</p>

<p>The Bramble Bush Man agreed to this with a chuckle and
sat there smiling to himself as they walked away.</p>

<p>“He’s happy over his show,” said Tommy. “He has fun
fooling everybody and making them think he’s wondrous wise.”</p>

<p>“He is wondrous wise,” said Mary, “and he’s happy because
we worked magic on him.”</p>

<p>But Muffs was beginning to think that her mother might
have something to do with his happiness. It was hard to make
her consent to seeing him but, finally, she gave in. She walked
with the children across the lawn to the place where he sat
waiting.</p>

<p>Muffs could not understand the timid way she approached
him or why they looked at each other for a moment and then
kissed. Strangers didn’t do things like that.</p>

<p>“Tommy,” she whispered. “Let me take those magic
glasses for a minute. I want to see something.”</p>

<div class="figcenter width300">
<img src="images/p30.jpg" width="300" height="281" alt="Let me take those magic
glasses for a minute." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
“Gee!” he exclaimed. “I forgot to give them to the Bramble
Bush Man.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, Tommy. I must get a better look
at him. Who is he anyway?”</p>

<p>“He’s the headless man. I thought you knew.”</p>

<p>“He is not. He’s the Bramble Bush Man. He’s the wisest
magician in the whole world and I’m one of his helpers,”
Mary added proudly, remembering her part in the show.</p>

<p>Then Muffs put on the magic glasses. She was beginning
to see it anyway, but now, with the glasses to help, she saw
as plainly as day.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s my daddy!” she exclaimed. “Only he used
to have a real moustache like that make-believe one he wore in
the show. He’s my daddy that went away to the ends of the
earth.”</p>

<p>The magician turned around and there was a new brightness
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“My little girl!” he said. “Do you remember? Will you
ever forgive your blundering old daddy for running away and
leaving such a wonderful woman as your mother?”</p>

<p>“She never told me that you were a magician,” Muffs
replied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moffet hung her head for a moment, looking like a
naughty little girl who has been punished. Then she confessed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think he was much of a magician, darling.”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t think your mother was much of an artist.
Maybe that’s why we didn’t get along.”</p>

<p>“Wise man,” she teased him.</p>

<p>Muffs and Mary and Tommy stood watching them. The
party was over and Mrs. Tyler had taken baby Ellen home long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
before. Great Aunt Charlotte had gone too. Only Mr. Tyler
and Donald were left. They strolled about on the far side of
the grove blowing out Japanese lanterns and when Mary saw
them she ran to keep them company.</p>

<p>Tommy was ready to go too but first he must return the
magician’s glasses. He reached in his pocket and held them
out. “Here,” he said. “I almost forgot these. I guess they’re
yours.”</p>

<p>“They were once,” replied the Bramble Bush Man. “But
I have a new pair now and your Guide will want his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell us before?” asked Muffs. “You
knew Tommy had them and all you needed to do was to tell
him they were yours.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, my dear,” he said. “I had to do a great
deal more than that. You were so sure the glasses belonged to
a wondrous wise man that I had to do something, well, rather
wonderful.”</p>

<p>“You did!” cried Miss Muffet. “It was wonderfuller than
wonderful. It was the most wonderfullest show in the world!”</p>

<p>“My! What big words,” laughed her mother, “but I
agree with all of them.”</p>

<p>“You think I’m wondrous wise too?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you are. You’re changed!”</p>

<p>“It was the children’s magic and something else too&mdash;the
words of that song Muffs sang.”</p>

<p>“I know. I’ll sing it again,” she said happily and when
she came to the part that went:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">For Love has made me wondrous wise.</div>
<div class="line">Your eyes have told me so,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
her father sang with her and looked into her mother’s lovely
brown eyes.</p>

<p>Right then Muffs knew that they wouldn’t be taking the
train back to New York and the crowded little studio and the
landlady who didn’t like children. They would be moving
into the Bramble Bush Man’s big, beautiful house and all the
bare places would be filled with her mother’s dainty things.
She could have the fairyland where she had slept for her very
own and perhaps her mother could have the glass topped palace
for a studio.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be so wonderful,” she said. “Mary and
Tommy can play with me all the time and so can Bunny Bright
Eyes. We can help you with your tricks too, can’t we Daddy
Brambles?”</p>

<p>“I like that name,” he said.</p>

<p>“But can’t we help you?” she insisted.</p>

<p>He looked at her with the old scowl that the headless man
used to wear. “Magic Makers like you help me with my poor
tricks?”</p>

<p>“You might even teach them a few,” her mother suggested.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! They’ll be too busy teaching me.”</p>

<p>But Muffs, who had learned a lot in a very short time,
took her father’s arm and then her mother’s arm and looking
up at them she said, “Come, let’s go home.”</p>

<p>It was almost midnight when they walked up the steps.
The house seemed to smile a welcome and its mysterious magic
room held forth a promise of more and more adventures for
Muffs and Mary and Tommy.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
